Set 1,"['Please have some compassion for these amazing creatures!  Elephants are  natural nomads and are not meant to be kept in captivity in zoos!  In the wild, they  are accustomed to walking hundreds of miles each day.  But in the zoo, no matter  how big their enclosures look to zoo visitors, they are tiny compared to the open  land in the wild.  It has been proven that zoo enclosures are terrible for the  physical and mental health of elephants.  Even with poaching, the average life of  an elephant in the wild is much older than an elephant in captivity!  All the  remaining elephants in zoos should be transferred to reserves and sanctuaries,  where they can live out their lives in giant expanses where they are free to roam  and forage.  Please, I implore you, help these brilliant, magnificent animals.', 'It is imperative that living conditions for elephants be improved in zoos and  circuses.  It should be required that living space for such enormous animals be  large enough to acommodate them comfortably (i.e., The Elephant Sanctuary in  Tennessee and PAWS in California have hundreds to thousands of acres) and that  they be allowed the freedom to roam and socialize.  Prolonged chaining, standing  for hours in their own excrement, being confined to barn stalls and suffering social  deprivation are conditions that no living creature should have to endure.   Additionally, the use of bullhooks and other tools of intimidation are cruel,  unnecessary, and should be outlawed.  With the inhumane conditions that so  many elephants live under, it is no wonder that captive elephants suffer from  neurotic behaviors.  No animal under human domain should have to go through  what elephants in circuses and zoos endure during their lifetimes.  Because we  have the power to change their lives for the better, why wait another second to get  the ball rolling?  Thank you for your attention to this matter.', 'Elephants are not given a fair treatment in zoos and circuses. We must remember  that in their natural habitat, these majestic wild animals are used to walk long  distances and socialize with other individuals of their own species. Their living  conditions at zoos and circuses can hardly emulate life in the wild. Intense  confinement, unnatural life conditions (like extreme weather, constant traveling,  unfit shelter, forced movements/positions, etc.) and social deprivation can cause  them to suffer a range of physical and mental illnesses (like arthritis, foot  diseases, digestive problems, neurosis, etc.). Many circuses and zoos train them  by using force, domination and violent tools such as bull hooks, electric prods and  chains, which exacerbate their physical and mental problems and also break their  spirits. I applaud the Detroit Zoo for putting their elephants welfare first and giving  them away to a sanctuary where they can have a better life. Hopefully, many more  will follow! I urge the authorities to protect these beautiful animals by making sure  the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) requirements are met and violators are prosecuted  and severely punished. Thank you!', 'All animals need to be treated with care and respect.', ""Circuses and many zoos control elephants through the use of force and  domination, aggressive use of bullhooks, and prolonged chaining. In many zoos,  elephants are confined to barn stalls for at least 12 hours a day when zoos are  closed, and in zoos in cold climates, elephants often spend weeks at a time  indoors during cold winter weather.  Elephants are the world's largest land mammals, and they require significant  amounts of space. In fact, in the wild, they can walk up to 30 miles a day. The  leading causes of death in captive elephants are foot disorders and arthritis, which  are caused by prolonged chaining, intense confinement, and forced inactivity.  Since 2000, more than half of the 49 elephants who have died at zoos accredited  by the Aquarium & Zoo Association never reached their 40th birthdays, dying far  short of their 70-year life expectancies.  Because of their intelligence, complexity, sensitivities, and unique social and  physical needs, elephants suffer immensely in small, unchallenging captive  environments. To make matters worse for elephants, in circuses, every instinctual  behavior is subject to discipline. If elephants reach for grass, try to comfort  friends, or extend their trunks to smell something new or different, they get hit with  bullhooks. If they blow a trick during a performance, they get beaten afterward.  Despite the fact that elephants fare miserably in captivity, zoos and circuses are  vociferously defending the status quo.   The use of bullhooks should be prohibited. These barbaric devices have only one  purpose: to inflict pain. In addition, the federal Animal Welfare Act should include  a ban on the use of electric-shock devices, chaining, and other instruments that  cause pain, injury, and suffering to elephants. ? Exhibitors of elephants should be required to provide large, climate-appropriate  environments that resemble elephants' natural habitats?similar to those at The  Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the Performing Animal Welfare Society  sanctuary in California. These two refuges provide thousands of acres where  elephants can roam, socialize, and maintain their health."", ""I am writing to express my support for all efforts to drastically improve conditions for captive elephants in this country.  I am asking the USDA to create touch new standards to include: 1.  The use of bullhooks should be prohibited.  The purpose of these is to inflict pain, no more and no less.  In addition, the federal Animal Welfare Act should include a ban on the use of electric shock devices, chaining, and other instruments that cause pain, injury and suffering to elephants. 2.  Exhibitors of elephants should be required to provide large, climate appropriate environments that resemble elephants' natural habitats--similar to The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee.

These animals are too smart and sensitive to undergo such  treatment.', ""I am concerned that ALL animals be treated as humanely as possible, especially those held in captivity in spaces very different from their natural habitat. ELEPHANTS have typically been kept in spaces much too small for their size resulting in needless injury and disease.   At the very minimum, I urge you to enforce regulations under the Animal Welfare Act, If we cannot uphold regulations now in force what's the point of making changes?  Would they fall in to disuse also?  Animals should not be subject to weapons such as bullhooks, chains, electric shock devices or other instruments of force unless other lives are in danger. Large animals need large spaces and freedom to move. Confining them to small spaces and doing so with chains or other restraints is unnecessarily cruel. If I treated my dog in this manner I would surely be reported and convicted of animal cruelty. Please have the same consideration for large animals in our zoo environments."", 'Please help us take better care of the elephants of the world.

We know that even the loose  regulations currently on the books are very difficult to enforce, and due to recent  science, very dated.  The USDA should convene and guide an  industry/governmental working group that would help produce an NPRM that takes  into account all the lessons learned and research of the last twenty years in terms  of captive elephant husbandry.  The US Government should take a leadership role  in meshing the recognition that conservation of habitat is touted as the ultimate  reason for zoos and other entertainment fora.  It should certainly take these  industries at their word in terms of requiring that wild habitat be conserved, and  that captive elephants be given the proper environment necessary to allow them to  lead as healthy and as normal lives as possible.  It is our duty to these animals  that have no choice in our decisions.  Most importantly, it is urgent that the USDA  understand that recent science has shown that elephants are extraordinarly  intelligent, and have much to share with the human race.

These two refuges provide hundreds to thousands of acres over which elephants can roam, socialize and maintain their health.  ? Prohibit the use of bullhooks, chains, electric shock devices and other instruments of force against elephants.   The clear reason we need change is self explanatory, in the suffering of animals kept in an unnatural environment. Elephants were designed to travel continuously, that is what keeps their feet and legs in an optimum performance level. Imagine keeeping a horse, who was also designed to travel at least 20 -30 miles a day, imagine that horse locked up in a boxstall for it's entire life....get a vision of his hooves and legs, muscle mass, etc  Anything LESS for the Elephants, than the reasons below is clearly distress to the animal.  The reasons the USDA must take action include:   Zoos and circuses are not giving elephants the conditions they require for their health and well-being. My grandchildren do not partake in any way shape or form a *circus* that utilizes the suffering of animals as it's *entertainment*. It is no lie about how you get an 8000# elephant to stand on it's trunk, you use a WHIP and a BULL HOOK. Standing and dancing is not natural for elephants, they do it out of FEAR and SUBMISSION. The control comes from force, domination and aggressive use of the bull hook and prolonged chaining. These methods cause constant stress as well as physical and psychological injury to elephants.   Accordingly, he Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide elephants with adequate space. Zoos are not meeting this requirement. It is time to get elephants OUT of the ZOO. Send them to Tennessee so they can roam free for the remainder of their natural life.  As it is obvious, elephants are big animals who need big spaces. In way too many zoos and circuses, this is not the case,  they suffer from lack of space, unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause a range of preventable ailments -- from painful arthritis and foot disease to reproductive and digestive disorders to neurotic behaviors like swaying and head bobbing.   Because of their intelligence, complexity and unique social and physical needs, elephants suffer in small, unchallenging zoo environments. Because of these unique qualities and complex needs, elephants deserve much, much higher standards than the ones that currently exist. The fact that elephants remember each other, after decades of being separated shouuld be statement enough about their intelligence.  It is definitely time to cut the chains and free the elephants, there is no reason in this new age of humanity that the suffering of ALL animals in zoos and circuses is even tolerated. I remember being a kid, I remember when this little carnival like thing came town in Minnesota 40 years ago, and they had an elephant, and I rode the elephant. My life was not better or worse for that experience....but it still haunts me that I partook in that elephants life of misery."", 'Animal Welfare-Elephants  I think conditions for captive elephants should be improved, ie, more space for  exhibitors to provide large, indiginous, climate-appropriate environments similar to  those at Elephant Sanctuary in Tenn. and PAWS in California.

The ANimla Welfare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide elephants  with adequate space are following this.  The animals are in locked spaces for too  many hours and they suffer greatly.  This is not how these animals were meant to  live in comparison to native elephants living in the jungles.

When is it going to be more  clear that it\'s simply ""not natural"" for them to be subjected to confinement and  torture?

Many elephant trainers have written about their training methods and they all revolve around  abusing the animal in order to put fear in them to become submissive. This is a disgusting  practice!

We o","['Thank you for your diligent commitment to animal welfare. I recommend that any modifications to the APHIS regulations be based on the most current science and information from the marine mammal specialists who have the most experience with these animals.   I believe it\'s essential that we have marine parks and aquariums to educate the public and increase our collective knowledge of these animals to better protect them in the wild. Many people, including me, might never have the opportunity to see these amazing animals if it weren\'t for these facilities. I have personally taken hundreds of guests through dolphin interactive program at Dolphin Quest and know firsthand that the staff\'s expertise and dedication to the animals is second to none.  As a long time supporter of marine parks and aquariums, I have learned so much about the animals, the environment, and the importance of conservation.  As a member of the International Marine Animal Trainers\' Association (IMATA), an organization representing the individuals who have dedicated their professional lives to actually providing daily care to marine animals in zoological settings, I can assure you that our members\' first priority is to act as the guarantors of the welfare of those in their charge.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.   If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.  Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day. With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.  With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.   Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.   I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.

I look forward to have the opportunity to visit SeaWorld and other marine mammal parks for years to come.  Please do not take away the only opportunity future generations have to learn how to care for the animals.  So called ""Animal Rights"" advocates who want action now forget that if our children don\'t learn how to actually care for the animals more and more will become extinct.  SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and other facilities like them give kids the chance to care.', 's a member of the International Marine Animal Trainers\' Association (IMATA), an organization representing the individuals who have dedicated their professional lives to actually providing daily care to marine animals in zoological settings, I can assure you that our members\' first priority is to act as the guarantors of the welfare of those in their charge.     IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species  to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  PLEASE -the requirements for our marine animals are NOT what people thought was adequate 30 yrs ago!!   We know more about the animals in captivity now and these old rules are NOT HUMANE --please do the right thing and listen to the scientists and allow our marine animals that have to be in captivity live in adequate space -  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'I believe it is important for the guidelines to be based on science and not emotion.

The risk and potential for catastrophic impact due to the introduction of FMD into U.S. cattle herds is not worth the small amount of trade that would be gained.   Our National WIFE policy states: WIFE urges prohibiting the importation of livestock from any country that experiences outbreaks of serious zoonotic diseases, including pests, until scientific evidence demonstrates the disease and/or pests have been eradicated or fully controlled and there is no known risk of further spread.  FMD is one of the most economically damaging animal diseases in the world. Brazil is not a country considered completely free of FMD with certain regions and adjacent countries having confirmed cases as recent as the past decade.  Although FMD is not a food safety concern, nor a threat to public health, but it does permanently affect the health, productivity and well-being of infected animals, spreading rapidly and also has an indirect impact on the livelihoods of ranchers and producers caring for those livestock.  Therefore, the National WIFE organization does not support this proposal for importation of fresh (chilled or frozen), maturated, and deboned beef from Brazil.

The disease is easily transferred from one vector to the next (via vehicles, clothing etc) and could devastate our already low beef herd. Please listen to the thousands of producers who do not want this trade partnership to go through - I would MUCH rather pay higher prices for beef now than open up trade with Brazil and pay astronomically higher prices for beef after the American beef herd has been decreased even further.

Known Foot and Mouth outbreaks still occur in South America, and our safe and wholesome beef produced in the USA would be completely devastated by FMD introduction. Do you not remember the photos of Britain and the carcasses being burned in huge piles when they had an ""accidental\' release of FMD?  In this case, USDA would be ""purposefully"" risking the safety of the US beef herds, one of the main goals of their job is to protect from harm. There is no way that USDA can control the Brazilian slaughter houses completely, removing safeguards, managing cross contamination that is inevitable. There is no such thing as a little FMD that can be tolerated.   South American vaccinates much of their beef against FMD, a practice not done in the US. There is no certainty that symptoms of FMD may not be hidden, yet the animals may carry or transmit the FMD virus. This is not acceptable practice going into a country free of FMD.   We produce enough beef in the US to feed our people. We need to be able to compete with high quality exports to nations that do not want any chance of FMD. Cheap beef from nations with substandard health management practices  and known suceptibility to bribery and malfeance, should not be a reason to jeopardize our sought-after beef from US ranchers and farmers.   Do not allow beef from Brazil into the United States of America at any time. Short term profit should not cloud the directive of the USDA to prevent importing ANY risk to our cattle herds here. Label all meat according to origin and you will see how the US consumer is concerned about source and trust in where their meat is produced.   With sincere concern, Katrin Kolder, DVM', 'I am Jay Evans and independent Rancher and Ranch Consultant involved in the Stocker, Feeder and Cow Calf Segments of Beef Cattle Business and I oppose the USDA APHIS proposed a rule to amend regulations to allow the importation of fresh (chilled or frozen) beef from a region of 14 States in Brazil into the United States. \uf0b7 The region of 14 States covered under the proposed rule include: Bahia, Distrito Federal, Espirito Santo, Goias, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, Sao Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins. \uf0b7 The consequences of an FMD outbreak in the United States would be extremely high in terms of disease-related costs, loss of animal life, trade losses and severe psychological effects on farmers and farming communities. \uf0b7 The most recent outbreaks of FMD within the proposed export region in Brazil occurred in 2006. \uf0b7 USDA APHIS does not consider the countries of South America to be FMD-free with the exception of Chile. \uf0b7 Outbreaks of FMD have occurred in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, all countries that had been classified as FMD-free without vaccination or FMD-free with vaccination by the OIE prior to the FMD outbreaks. \uf0b7 FMD has not been eradicated from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru. \uf0b7 While we support expanding export markets based on internationally sound science, concern exists regarding the possible increased risk for the introduction of FMD into the U.S. with the future implementation of this proposed rule. \uf0b7 Our concerns for the possible increased risk of introducing FMD into the U.S. through the proposed rule are also shared by a group of eight United States Senators who signed a letter, January 23, 2014, to the Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, asking for an extension of the comment period to provide adequate stakeholder review of the proposed rule and supporting documents. \uf0b7 \uf0b7 Concerning the APHIS risk assessment for the Region in Brazil, the release assessment, exposure assessment and consequence assessment appear incomplete with regard to the necessary steps and requirements outlined in the international standards as described in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, Chapter 2.1. \uf0b7 We urge APHIS to perform a quantitative risk assessment for the risk of FMD from the importation of fresh, maturated, deboned beef from a Region in Brazil into the United States in order to reduce subjectivity and to provide a better analysis of uncertainty and the effectiveness of mitigation measures for the FMD risk, given the high consequences of this risk. APHIS performed a quantitative risk assessment in 2002 for the risk of FMD with the importation of fresh beef from Uruguay, a country like Brazil, also considered by the OIE to be FMD free with vaccination practiced. \uf0b7 USDA APHIS needs to strongly consider updating the 1995 scientific information used to verify the exposure assessment and the resultant data used to establish the FMD exposure risk. \uf0b7 APHIS needs to refocus the consequence assessment to align with the scope of the risk assessment. \uf0b7 As a critical part of the regulatory impact analysis associated with the proposed rule, APHIS should perform a comprehensive up-to-date economic analysis to identify the economic consequences to all of the affected commodity groups in U.S. animal agriculture from a possible FMD outbreak in the United States. \uf0b7 Furthermore, if the proposed rule should move forward, APHIS needs to consider the development of an ongoing APHIS oversight protocol to monitor Brazils compliance with risk mitigation beyond the usual port of entry testing. \uf0b7 We cannot comfortably rely on a self-reporting system in Brazil to mitigate the U.S. risk for FMD. \uf0b7 Our concerns are for the resulting economic and animal health consequences should FMD enter the United States as a result of the proposed rule. \uf0b7 The APHIS regulatory analysis highlights the possible consumer benefit from the import of 40,000 metric tons of fresh beef annually from Brazil but, fails to address the economic impact on consumers for the possible risk for the introduction of FMD virus to the United States and a resultant FMD outbreak \uf0b7 The risk to U.S. agriculture and to our cattle producers is far too great and the economic and animal health consequences far too significant to move forward with this proposed rule without first absolutely establishing that an attitude of willingness for compliance and a sophisticated infrastructure are present in Brazil to allow for the consistent performance of all FMD risk mitigation measures.

I can assure you that if you create a price bias between states in Brazil by allowing the importation of beef from certain areas, that there we be an illigal flow of cattle to those areas of higher prices.  I am also certain that cattle will cross the border from Paraguay.  Hoof and mouth disease can be carried by wind-born dust, dirt on tires and shoes, and by wild animals.

Billy & Linda Mann', 'Re: Docket No. APHIS-2009-0017         Regulatory and Analysis and Development         PPD, APHIS         Station 3A-03.8         4700 River Road, Unit 118         Riverdale, MD         20737-1238  Title: Importation of Beef: Region in Brazil  April 14, 2014  I am David Winters and appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this proposed rule.  I am a cattle and sheep rancher from southwest Texas and have also been involved in importing and exporting cattle, sheep and their products for many years.  From the standpoint of being personally involved in international trade I am acutely aware of many of the benefits of opening livestock trade across international borders.  I have also served on the Texas Animal Health Commission and thus am familiar with many of the challenges facing trading partners as they try to facilitate business in a science-based manner.  While the theoretical risk of introducing Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) from this region in Brazil from fresh and frozen beef is low provided the stated controls and in place and functional, I find that there are several issues and items lacking in the Docket and supportive material that should be addressed:  \tA qualitative risk assessment was done as stated and the concluding results reported.  However APHIS apparently relied heavily on site visits by agency professionals and I have not been able to locate or review the specifics that were assessed.  For example, if deficiencies were found how were they corrected and if measures were recommended by APHIS, how were they addressed?  APHIS has, in some cases, conducted quantitative risk assessments when considering regionalization requests such as this one.  I believe that due to the beef export potential from this region and the seriousness of the disease concerns, a quantitative risk assessment should have been done and the results made available with this docket.    \tIf this region in Brazil is provided access to the U.S. market for fresh and frozen beef, that action is likely to raise the value of beef exports from that region and cause an economic incentive for trans-shipments from other unapproved areas/regions.  In my opinion, APHIS should but has not in a direct way outlined how the FMD risk from trans-shipments would be prevented.  \tThe conditions that APHIS outlined in the proposed rule (as were applied to Uruguay) are appropriate in my opinion, although risk was assessed differently for Uruguay, however ongoing verification of implemented risk-control measures by Brazils Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) is not stated other than to state that periodic inspections of slaughter establishments by APHIS representatives can be made.  I believe that it is important to establish a more rigorous and routine system of verification of risk control measures is very important in this case.  In the case of national program diseases in the U.S. for example, states report annually on their status and how they are addressing various issues.  In conclusion, I strongly recommend that APHIS address the content in these three points above and, if the findings warrant it, re-propose the rule along with all of the supporting documentation.

Over 97% of all rare earth magnets are manufactured China, and seeing as how impossibly burdensome of a task it would be for US customs to filter out certain times of magnets, the CPSC would really only be shutting down US companies.  So even though there is ZERO record of anybody swallowing magnet SOLD BY US, magnet spheres will become harder to obtain than ammunition in America because they are an ingestion hazard.  This isn\'t so much a discussion about the dangers of magnets, but more the CPSC and Pediatric Gastroenterologist organizations trying to flex their power.  They\'ve organized their members to submit comments that continually repeat that ""people cannot be trusted to listen to warnings,"" while never addressing the arguments against theirs.  If the CPSC won\'t listen to the 85%+ public consensus against the ban, perhaps the CPSC should listen to Nancy ""Voice-of-Reason"" Nord, the CPSC\'s own most experienced commissioner, when she says:  \tThe assumption that warnings don\'t work, undermine past safety standards deemed acceptable by the CPSC and US Congress. \tThe ban is overly broad.  There are two distinct hazard patterns that should be addressed:  Children under 5 tonguing their environment, and teenagers mimicking piercings.  And the ban includes products (like Zen Magnets) that have not demonstrated similar risks. \tThese magnets have much more utility and lower instance of hazard than other products on the market.  Thank you for your consideration.', ""The proposed ban is overreaching and unreasonable, and would destroy at least one American business with no reported incidents involving their products. Zen Magnets are sold online to informed consumers, and as a result have not been involved in any of the reported child injury cases. This is blatant proof that removing small magnet sets from children's retail stores, and regulating their sale would be a successful alternative to an outright ban. The CPSC is aware of this situation and makes no accusations of injuries in their filing against Zen Magnets, yet is still determined to shut down the American small business for the failings of other resellers. Unfortunately in this case, the CPSC has decided that intimidation is favorable to regulation, and that Americans are incapable of being informed and responsible caregivers."", ""The thought of banning magnet sets purely because they are harmful if swallowed is ludicrous. There are vast quantities of things that are not meant to be ingested that can cause serious harm or death if it occurs, many of which are found in almost every home in America.  Improper use of a countless number of every day items can be dangerous. The answer is to inform consumers. I suppose we should ban hair dryers because they can electrocute you if exposed wiring comes in contact with water, and you become the shortest path from the electricity to ground? Or cleavers because you could chop your fingers off if not careful? Or perhaps we shouldn't sell bleach and other cleaning chemicals, as if you were to mistakenly drink it you could poison yourself.  I don't understand how this got beyond the first conversation about it. Someone with some common sense should have put their foot down on this mind bogglingly ludicrous proposition, before wasting everyone's time with it and attempting to put American companies out of business. Pathetic."", 'As a Pediatric Gastroenterologist, I support these standards.  Rare earth magnets are very strong, sufficiently so that ingestion of multiple magnets can lead to perforations of loops of bowel requiring surgical repair.  While I acknowledge that the intent of the manufacturers and distributors is not to have children and adolescents ingest the magnets, unfortunately currently labelling has not prevented a large number of ingestions and injuries from occurring as has been reported in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and  Nutrition.

More specifically, your data indicates a probable number of injuries around 1700 and only 50 specific reported incidents.  In 2009 alone, there were 4564 children confirmed killed by automobiles[1].  By your own logic, we should also ban the sale of automobiles since automobiles have a fatality rate almost 90 times greater in just that one year than injury rate over a 3 year period.  But we don't do that, because automobiles are for adults, not children (and they're marketed as such).  And like these magnet sets, when used by a responsible adult, they are harmless, educational and fun.  Any product, event or other interaction is dangerous when used irresponsibly.

I have had my Zen Magnets for two years and let me just say; they are a life saver! From all the stress that college has presented me, I sometimes become so frazzled from all the homework and exams I have that the only way I can relieve stress is by making sculptures with my magnets.  Now I understand that the whole banning of the magnetic spheres is due to the fact that they can be lethal if swallowed. I understand that. First and for most, when I received my magnets two years ago, the first thing I noticed when I open the package was the warning label that stated that stated the magnets may be lethal if swallowed so the companies are definitely putting out an effort to ensure the safety of people who tinker with these magnets.Secondly, it is not the manufacturing companies fault for having issues with fatality due to magnets. Sure the magnets are very strong hence \'super\' magnet but that is all part of the product. Think of fireworks for example. the fireworks clearly state the warnings that go with the product and the danger of the firework is all part of the product. The problem with the fatalities from the magnets is parents are not watching their children when their children are playing with the magnets and do not notice the children placing the magnets in their mouths! Another reason is that some people are not ""intelligent"" enough to be playing with these magnets. It is their fault, not the manufacturing companies!!  If you are definitely sure of banning the spherical magnets, you might as well ban fireworks while you are at it.

And in 1999, Benjamin, a 4-year-old endangered baby elephant who had  been removed from his mother before she could teach him to swim, stepped into a  pond while the circus was traveling through Texas and drowned as he tried to  move away from a trainer who was poking him with a bullhook. These are just two  examples of the many elephants that have cruelly and senselessly died while  forced to be a part of the circus. While elephants can live to be 70 years old,  since the year 2000 over 25 elephants have died in zoos before reaching the age  of 35.  It?s time that people reject entertainment that entails the suffering of elephants.  Elephants, who in the wild roam over large distances, should not spend the  majority of their lives traveling in all sorts of weather conditions with chains on  their feet.  Elephants are extremely intelligent, social animals. Circuses, as well as zoos are  unable to provide elephants with a large enough area to roam, and with proper  stimulus.  In order for elephants in the circus to be shown ""who?s boss"" they are beaten with  bullhooks, whips, axe handles, and shocked with electric prods.  In addition to being cruel to the elephants, patronizing circuses with elephants  acts is also dangerous to people.

I applaud APHIS for evaluating, and where necessary, updating the regulations by objectively assessing the latest peer reviewed science and input from industry experts on the best practices for care of these incredible animals. I am concerned that individuals and groups opposed to marine mammals in a zoological settings misuse the process of updating marine mammal care regulations in their attempts to end the display marine mammals.  They do so by encouraging APHIS to impose rules which are not necessary, counter to decades of successful care programs and processes, and impede the great education and conservation work done by the zoological community.  I encourage APHIS to evaluate the marine mammal care regulations based upon on the merits of applicable peer reviewed literature and current best practice standards; in cases where insufficient literature exists, input and observation of successful practices within the industry should be strongly considered.', 'My name is Heather Franklin.  I am a former Sea World and Discovery Cove marine mammal trainer and a professional animal trainer of 18 years.   I have had the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the regulations and would like to submit the below comments for consideration.  The additional regulation components specific to interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of programs. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation, or how further regulation would benefit marine mammals.  As a trainer, I feel that if interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, programs in which trainers bring marine mammals, such as, but not limited to pinnipeds, into a public area under stimulus control.  I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best.   Each animal is so different.  So many factors go in to how long each session should run and what they will entail for each particular animal.  In my professional experience working in an interaction program, the amount of interaction time each animal had per day could vary depending on many details including but not limited to: recent and long term behavioral history, social structure/hierarchy, and breeding behaviors.  The training team makes an approximate plan for how the day\'s training and programs will run, but it ultimately is up to the animals how the day flows, not legislation.  To put regulations/time restrictions on trainers and animals seems counterproductive.  We treat animals as individuals and need the flexibility to provide an individualized training program for each of them.  Training is not one size fits all, nor is one size is best for all.   In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day. With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.  With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.  As a trainer, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Again, one size does not fit all.  One particular behavior that is harmless in one animal can be a pre-cursor to something completely different in another animal. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an INDIVIDUAL, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    Trust animal care and training professionals to make the best decisions for their animals. They have dedicated their lives to the animals in their care!

I support the proposed ruling to provide sufficient shade to animals in outdoor pools so the animals can get out of direct sunlight.  More space in the pools is also needed, and while this isn\'t in the  proposed update to the law, it should be.  The pitiful sized pools that these animals have to spend their entire lives in is horribly cruel and inhumane.

The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  The treatment of marine wildlife in captivity is heartbreaking to witness, and needs to be scrutinized in depth, and policies updated... or abolished entirely.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'I support marine mammal  I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species  to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.

Thank you for your","['I, as a cattle producer and consumer of the United States of America and the State of South Dakota, oppose the importation of any beef from the country of Brazil. Brazil has clearly demonstrated that it lacks the ability to regulate and eradicate the Foot and Mouth Disease, and if imported I feel this would put the cattle industry of United States in grave danger.  I oppose this proposed rule.  Shawn Fox Mobridge, South Dakota', 'Yes, the national beef herd is small now. But calf prices are high and ranchers will increase their herds. If you allow this imported beef  prices will drop and the national herd will get smaller and  the United States will loose its food self sufficency! And this is even more likely if Foot and Mouth Disease is spread to the USA.  Ranching is hard work and very cash intensive compared to other buisnesses, please keep the financial reward at a level that permits ranchers to operate.', 'I am opposed to allowing the importation of beef in any form from Brazil. Doing so would greatly increase the risk of introducing Foot and Mouth disease to the US and would be disastrous to our cattle industry and our economy. A Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak would cause a dramatic increase in the cost of beef for US consumers and would be an even further setback to the cattle industry. We are already at a record low cattle inventory and the destruction of animals required by an outbreak would be devastating. I own a small farm and raise cattle as part of my operation. The cost of expanding my cow herd is already very expensive. Why add another risk to producers when there are already so many others that are out of our control? I strongly recommend against adopting this rule.', 'Brazil has active hoof and mouth disease, it is not worth the risk to the US cattle industry to allow this importation. Keep the US foremost in your thoughts and plans.', 'As a cattle producer I am very much opposed to any cattle or beef imported from any part of Brazil !!!', ""I am a ranch wife and mother of a large family, who mostly live and work in ranch country.  Do not allow the interests of a few to undermine beef production here in our homeland.  Ranching is really the only viable option to sustainably manage most of the rangeland in our United States.  If you break the ranch producers, what will take their place?  On one hand, the USDA is seeking ways to keep young people actively ranching out here in the Western states, and on the other hand, USDA APHIS is actively seeking to sabotage and undermine that very same effort.  Stop working against your very own country and turning it into a wasteland.  Stop imports from damaging our own producers both in the market and through exposure to FMD and other possible diseases. I am submitting this on behalf of my children and grandchildren as well as in my husband's and my own best interest to keep rural communities and schools and tax bases in stable condition enough to continue into the future."", 'Please do Not allow Brazilian beef, goats cloven food into US to eat. Pamela Campus', ""Having the safest food supply in the world I don't know why we would endanger it with bringing in a known disease that would destroy what is left of the US cattle Industry."", 'This will surely result in Foot and Mouth Disease in USA.  We cant even keep donkey meat out of our imported beef products', 'The proposed rule talks of risk mitigation; yet, here in the U.S. there are periodic meat recalls when the ""system"" breaks down, the most recent being the 8.7 million pound recall by Rancho Feeding Corp.  While there is an ongoing criminal investigation, the fact remains that meat recalls are a fact of life in the U.S. and that there are system breakdowns.  If meat recalls due to system breakdowns cannot be eliminated domestically, how can ""mitigation"" of risk be accomplished when a foreign nation and a host of transportation issues are involved?  Any importation of fresh meat from a nation that has FMD results in an INCREASED RISK, regardless of ""mitigation"" measures.  A FMD infection from Brazil would be devastating for the United States Cattle industry.  The question needs asked:  qui bono? -- who benefits?  Certainly not American ranchers.  That USDA/APHIS would even promulgate this rule is shocking,  irresponsible and an abdication of statutorily imposed obligations.  But again, much of what USDA does today--livestock ID/traceability being another example--is contrary to the interests and expressed concerns of U.S. ranchers.  USDA promulgates rules but never listens to those affected by its rules.

This country does not need to be exposed to FMD from any country that has it.', 'Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule that would allow the importation of beef from several states in Brazil. As President of Minnesota Farmers Union (MFU), and National Farmers Union (NFU) Secretary, I am writing for thousands of farmers across the country.  NFU policy is clear in its position regarding importation of livestock products from countries that have a history of unresolved foot and mouth disease (FMD). The following is an excerpt from the recently adopted grassroots policy statement from NFU members:  Livestock health is critical to production agriculture and our nations ability to provide a safe food supply. Achieving the necessary means to ensure livestock health is a priority for NFU. We support good animal husbandry practices as the primary means of livestock health maintenance, as well as the following initiatives to ensure livestock health: Ban livestock, animal protein products and meat imports that would jeopardize U.S. efforts to eradicate livestock diseases including BSE and Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD);  We strongly oppose the proposal to resume importation of fresh beef from the fourteen Brazilian states listed in the federal register notice. Our members contend that FMD from that region of Brazil still poses a significant threat to U.S. livestock herds. Any changes to the current ban could pose substantial threats to family farmers, ranchers and the general public due to the very real possibility of transmission of FMD to U.S. livestock, resulting in eroded consumer confidence in our food supply.   MFU is concerned by rulemaking processes at the USDA that may weaken disease protection measures critical to protecting domestic livestock from the introduction of FMD and other animal diseases, particularly from Brazil. Inconsistencies between animal health disclosures reported by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), erode our confidence in the safety of beef imports from countries with a history of FMD presence and a poor food safety record. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled Brazilian cooked and canned meat on three occasions in 2010 due to drug contamination.   Previous import bans implemented by USDA have divided our trading partners into sub-national geographic regions that are largely insulated from other livestock-producing areas, thereby limiting risk of FMD transmission. The fourteen states that are being considered by this USDA rulemaking process are but one of the four regions in Brazil. The last case of FMD in the fourteen-state region in Brazil was in 2001. Even though the fourteen Brazilian states in question are considered to be FMD-Free by the OIE, regular vaccinations are required. Brazil has not been able to prevent the spread of FMD into its borders from neighboring countries, and as recently as 2011, Paraguay reported two outbreaks of FMD within 250 miles of the Brazilian border.   MFU members are proud of the disease prevention system that has been in place for livestock in the United States, which has not had a confirmed case of FMD since 1929. This is an advantage to be developed and must not be put at risk. There are very few positives associated with allowing livestock products from regions of Brazil that are known to have a history of FMD to be brought into our country. There are many possible undesirable outcomes from such an arrangement. Importing Brazilian beef and other livestock products is a risk not worth taking.  U.S. farmers and ranchers are known throughout the world for the high standards to which livestock herds are raised and our long-standing disease prevention efforts. In the rare instances when disease has impacted a portion of the livestock herd, economic devastation has followed. When Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first identified in the U.S. in December of 2003, sixty-five of our trading partners eventually put partial or full bans on our beef. According to a Kansas State University study, the U.S. beef industry lost between $2.9 billion and $4.2 billion in 2004 alone because of BSE. Rural America should not again be subjected to severe losses simply because of lax standards for animal imports.  The economic costs of an FMD outbreak in the United States would be tremendous. A 2002 study conducted by Purdue University and the Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health at APHIS found that if an epidemic similar to the outbreak that occurred in the U.K. in 2001 were to strike the United States, a loss of $14 billion in U.S. farm income (in 2002 dollars) would result. This includes costs of quarantine and eradication of animals, a ban on exports, and reduced consumer confidence.   On behalf of MFU members, I urge USDA to defend family farmers and ranchers by turning back this attempt to loosen restrictions on imports from countries that are affected by FMD. Thank you for your consideration.', 'I do NOT support the importation of beef products (frozen or not) from Brazil.', 'Please do not let these imports come into America.  Farmers and ranches strive to keep our meat supply safe and our beef healthy.  It is time to think of Americans and their livelihoods.  I am not convinced that the beef coming from Brazil is foot and mouth disease free.  Lets make other countries have as strict of regulations as Americans do in all aspects of imports.', 'Allowing beef imports from a country that has FMD is the equivalent of playing Russian Roulette with the US Meat supply.  This proposal is slightly more ignorant than placing the National Disease Lab in Manhattan, Ks. This is the most contagious disease known.  It will escape the lab.

A few years ago the beef industry was concerned at the increase in the price of corn would cause the consumer to pay more.  They have no concern now whether the consumer pays more or not.  They tried to destroy the ethanol industry (and still are)  to get cheap corn with no concern for the corn grower.      If the meat from Brazil is chilled or frozen, that should pose no danger of diseases to the cattle industry.  They want the import gates closed and the export gates wide open, and that on top of an already short supply of beef.  $250 per hundred calves and $150 per hundred fats is unbelievably high.

I do not believe we should expect American producers to meet environmental, animal welfare, quality assurance, and labor standards, but then allow importation of product that may not be held to the same expectations and requirements.   Third, our US beef herd has shrunk to its lowest level in 50 years. We need economic incentives to increase our national herd. We will not accomplish this with importation of product from Brazil.', 'Importing beef from a ""region"" in Brazil is not a good idea.  The proposed rule describes a ""region"" in Brazil that is surrounded by and part of a larger region of South America that is not free of FMD.  While the proposed rule praises the steps that have been taken by the Brazilian government to make it more likely that they can ""control"" an outbreak should it occur in the ""region,"" those measures will not keep an outbreak from occurring in the first place.    The most effective way to keep FMD out of a ""region"" in Brazil that is surrounded by and part of a larger region of South America that is not free of FMD is to offer no financial incentive to bring cattle or other livestock from the larger region into the FMD free ""region.""  If the FMD free ""region"" is allowed to export beef to the United States, this will cause a significant increase in the value of cattle in that ""region."" This increased value will be a huge financial incentive to bring cattle from the larger region into the FMD free ""region.""  These cattle that people sneak into the FMD free ""region"" will sooner or later bring FMD with them.  That FMD will sooner or later get exported to the United States. A good example of how difficult it can be to control a border is the border between the United States and Mexico.  The financial incentive to cross illegally makes it impossible to keep people from crossing illegally. If you offer a financial incentive to bring cattle into a ""region,"" those cattle will come to that ""region\' whether or not it is legal.  The proposed rule compares FMD free ""region"" in Brazil to the nation of Uruguay. However, the FMD free ""region"" in Brazil is much larger than the nation of Uruguay, with much more border to protect.  Also, it is not a nation, it is a collection of states.  I live in Texas, which is bordered by four states and by Mexico.  It is much easier to get cattle to and from the neighboring states than it is to get them to and from Mexico.  The comparison to Uruguay is not relevant to the issue of importing beef from a ""region"" in Brazil.', 'Do not pass this rule, allowing fresh beef to be imported to the US from Brazil and Argentina.

But to even think about it at this point and time would be devastating to US Ranchers.  Our cattle market prices at this time are good but they need to stay this way.  Importing Brazilian meat would bring these prices down and wreck our markets.  Our farmers and ranchers have been through many tough times lately between drought and severe  fall storms that have greatly impacted our cattle industry in the Midwest.  There are many operators who are still trying to catch up from reducing or selling off their herds to due the latest drought.  High feed costs during this period set them back as well.  Plus the severe winter storm earlier this fall that drastically killed thousands of head of cattle in the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Nebraska.  This storm impacted so many ranchers by great loss of percentages of numbers in their cow herds,  thus reducing this year and further years income.  We need prices to sustain to keep people operating in the cattle industry.  These ranchers need to be able to catch back up and stay in business as well as give young people an opportunity or hope of getting into the cattle industry and be able to make a living.  Increased farming due to government guarantees on crop loss or disaster has decreased grazing available because more and more grass is being broken and farmed.  This has lead to increased cost for grazing leases.  So considering devastating losses and increased costs to raise livestock, now more than ever we need prices to maintain.  Our industry CANNOT take a reduction in market prices.  Letting Brazilian beef into the country will lead to market prices falling.  Your actions will decide the fate over our American ranch family's.  Make the right choice and deny the importation of Brazilian beef.  Leon Garrett Pierre, SD"", 'No, do not import beef from Brazil.

Outbreaks of FMD have occurred in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, all countries that had been classified as FMD-free without vaccination or FMD-free with vaccination by the OIE prior to the FMD outbreaks. FMD has not been eradicated from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru. *There is significant concern regarding the willingness, committed resources, and  infrastructure of Brazil to consistently perform adequate risk management in order to mitigate the risk for the introduction of FMD into the United States through the importation of fresh Brazilian beef. *The consequences of an FMD outbreak in the United States would be extremely high in  terms of disease-related costs, loss of animal life, trade losses and severe psychological  effects on farmers and farming communities. The United States has not experienced an outbreak of FMD since 1929. *While the APHIS regulatory analysis highlights the possible consumer benefit from the import of 40,000 metric tons of fresh beef annually from Brazil it fails to address the economic impact on consumers for the possible risk for the introduction of FMD virus to the United States and a resultant FMD outbreak. **The risk to U.S. agriculture and to our cattle producers is far too great and the economic and animal health consequences far too significant to move forward with this proposed rule without first absolutely establishing that an attitude of willingness for compliance and a sophisticated infrastructure are present in Brazil to allow for the consistent performance of all FMD risk mitigation measures.', 'Do not let Brazil import fresh cut beef because the risk of importing hoof and mouth disease is too great.', 'We have safe food and want to keep it above reproach.

It is up to parents to understand the hazards and keep the magnets out of the reach of children.  Regulations of this sort are a slippery slope.

Thumbtacks shouldn't be given to children, either, but often come in bright colors and interesting shapes. A swallowed thumbtack can be as dangerous to a child as a magnet, yet it would be considered ludicrous to propose banning them.

Being able to have something malleable like these spherical magnetic sets helps keep my hands from cramping, and nothing else I've tried seems to work.

I cannot understand the CPSCs overzealous attack on magnets, especially when there are products like balloons and detergent pods still on the market.  The CPSC does not appear to be using the same standard for magnets as the one used for balloons.  Balloons have killed more children than any other childs toy and it continues to kill children every year.  Yet the CPSC feels that education and warning labels are sufficient for balloons.  How then can the CPSC say warning labels will be ineffective for magnets, but are just fine for balloons?  If this ban is successful, I fear a dangerous precedent will be set.  Where will such bannings stop?  The government cannot mandate common sense.  There is a saying You cant fix STUPID!

The increase in danger posed by magnets is unimportant; even pocket change can kill under the right circumstances. It is not your job to keep my children safe, it is mine.   20% of injuries are from teens who should know better than to put such objects in their mouth.

Banning them is not the solution.   Thank you for your consideration of this problem.', ""Sell these magnets to adults and educate people on the packaging of the risks.   Trampolines, skateboards, and pogo sticks are far more dangerous yet they are still sold for people of all ages.  Don't make something illegal just because there are a few stupid people out there that think it is okay to let their kid play with toys unsupervised.     A big warning on the front about adult supervision is appropriate."", 'This regulation is putting a ban on a toy that was never designed for children to use. Yes, it may look friendly enough, however this hobby toy comes with a rather clear warning about swallowing the magnets. This ban is also the result of parental neglegence, and under no circumstance should the government become responsible for irresponsible parents. Those who neglect the warnings that come with the product should not be able to do such a thing. If the government feels so compelled to be involved, at least make an official age limit (and warning) to make it clear this product is only for adult use. Bit do not ban the product outright.', 'The outright banning of a product, based on the fact that it can be dangerous to unattended children, seems so out of line with American values that I\'m having troubled we are discussing it. You should not legislate broader society to safeguard against ignorant or irresponsible parents.   Any number of items sitting around my household could be banned under a similar line of ""for the greater good"" type thinking. Household cleaners are extremely toxic and typically stored at a level young children reach. Outlets don\'t come with built in insulating plastic safety inserts and are less than a foot from the floor. I\'m sure some children have injured themselves with both of these items. While individual instances are tragic they are not widespread.   The bottom line is individual responsibility for one\'s actions has been and should continue to be a hallmark of American society. If you introduce a product into your home that has characteristics that could injure your children and don\'t take the necessary precautions you are negligent. Not governing agencies that required labeling of these risks. Not manufacturer\'s who provided warnings.', ""Please don't ban magnetic toys! This is a parental issue, not a policy one. As long as there are warnings on the packaging, these toys should be available."", ""This is not right, you should NOT be regulating a product that is no risk to an adult. There are THOUSANDS of items out there that children can choke on. You can't start banning all of them. Big warning labels, like all toys with choking hazards, but at the end of the day it has to be the responsibility of the children's guardians - be them the parents, family member, teacher, ect. - to know what may be dangerous for children to choke on and to keep it away from them.  Please DO NOT PASS THIS RULE - if you do it's a travesty to the free market and the democracy we live in!"", 'The proposed rule is an overreaction.  Please get an economist to look the statistics of the number of magnets sets sold and the number of people who have come in contact with those sets vs. the number of incidents of people swallowing the magnets.  The number is going to come into hundred thousandths (.000001) as a percentage.  The risk is miniscule.  Rare earth magnets have brought me countless hours of joy and it is a shame a ban is the proposed solution.', ""Please don't ban them. :("", 'I believe this Safety Standard in a ""knee jerk"" reaction to a perceived probem. Product warnings and consumer education should be enough of a requirement. There should be some responsibility placed on the purchaser of the product. After all, if we took action for every ""dangerous"" product, we would be banning almost every product that could cause an injury. Examples could include, bicycles, trampolines, and pools.

Zoos and circuses should consider the Elephant Sanctuary and the Performing Animal Welfare Society's sanctuary in Georgia to be models for how their elephants should be treated.

My relief quickly turned to disappointment, however, to discover the improvements barely go beyond requiring shade for the captive animals' enclosures, as well as easier access ramps for seals, sea lions and polar bears.  Not only did the amount of time INCREASE from two to three hours for swim with captive dolphin programs, not a single significant change to improve the lives of these long-ranging, highly intelligent animals has been proposed. There has been zero increase in the required space of the enclosures, a shocking and deplorable omission considering the needs of long-ranging cetaceans. In a tank that is allowed to be a mere 12 feet deep, an adult orca's fluke would drag on the bottom the tank if the orca was in an upright position. Also, there has been no noise restrictions or water temperature requirements per species proposed, and why is fresh water allowed for pinnipeds?!   APHIS, please re-assess these areas of great concern and upgrade your standards to more humane conditions that will actually improve the welfare of these complex animals. The public is becoming aware of the cruelty of captivity, and it behooves the government allowing this practice to regulate the industry to the highest possible standards based on science, not the needs of the captive animal industry. On the top of your agency's revisions list should be much more room for these intelligent, captive creatures to swim, and also somewhere to retreat from the natural aggression that arises in such stressful, small enclosures."", ""Marine parks are a vital link between our increasingly detached public and our increasingly distressed marine world.

Regulation is an important part of any endeavor, especially one as multifaceted as the care of, and interaction with, marine animals.

I was immediately drawn to the respect and love between the staff and the dolphins and sea lions.  I began a learning experience immediately.  I have participated in every program offered, including a week-long Adult DolphinLab.  I have watched so many people from other countries visiting DRC, I have witnessed a dolphin birth, watched and participated in many sessions.  I have viewed educational movies and watched research sessions.  My participation in recycling was reinforced by what I have learned from DRC.  I cannot imagine a life without access to the magnificent mammals at DRC.  They are a non-profit and I am extremely worried that actions proposed by APHIS will jeopardize their ability to continue the commitment to these animals and the education of the public.  Some of these sea lions and dolphins are rescues and non-releasable as well as those born there.  DRC is a FAMILY and no animal is ever forced to interact.    Research is ongoing and much remains to be discovered and shared with the public in years to come.  DRC has made contributions to the medical care of the animals and extended their lifespan.  I have read and experienced first hand the research being done at DRC/  I am aware of the proposals to mandate one trainer per dolphin in every interaction/program, as well as having one trainer observing each dolphin underwater as well.  In 12 years, I have never witnessed one single negative issue in the way programs are handled.  I have been safe and so have the dolphins.  The mutual enjoyment is priceless.  Making these changes will certainly negatively impact DRC.  I know their priority is safety.  It is working.  I know they will not compromise their mission, so adding so much additional staff will impact expansion programs and, most likely, cost of touring and participating in programs.  Less people will be able to afford the cost of learning about our oceans, these magnificent animals, and the need to educate our world before it is too late to preserve the oceans and the life within them.

We are vehemently oppsed to the importation of meat from Brazil.  As a known country with a FMD problem we cannot in good conscience accept that USDA, the very department set up to protect the American farmer and rancher, is considering this potentially devastating move.  In this business of cattle production, every day brings with it enough natural torments to try our resolve but to have such a blatantly man-made decision that could eliminate a score of cattle producers through no fault of their own is unthinkable and unconscienable.  We are asking that you support us in this battle and stand up to the USDA's decision to import Brazilian beef.  We are counting on you to be our voice.  Thank you.  Nina Kunz"", 'I beg you not to allow imports of meat or livestock from ANY country with FMD. It will not only destroy the livestock industry, but will cause a horrible financial deficit.', 'I am totally opposed to the importation of beef from  Brazil.   Currently in the USA we are watching PEDv spread though the pork industry.  Even with knowledge that PED is in the USA and how to keep it from spreading we are loosing millions of little pigs.  That is sad, but the true sadness is the fact that those pigs represented paychecks for American farmers and their families.   PED continues to spread and many dollars and valuable protein which would have gone in to the food system is gone.   The fact the that risk of transmission of FMD from chilled meat is not a comfort to United States Ranchers.  PED affects only pigs; FMD can infect multiple species and would shut down the export of meat from the US to other countries.  The US meat industry can not take even a small risk in that area.  In Montana we have a Designated Surveillance Area where cattle are tested for Brucellosis on a regular basis.  The risk of brucellosis transmission from elk to cattle is only .00024 percent, yet there were four cases of brucellosis transfer from elk to cattle in the DSA in 2013.     The US cattle, hog and sheep industries can not take the ""low risk"" of transmission of FMD.  The risk must be zero or less. Again I am opposed to the import of meat from ANY country with FMD in it\'s livestock.', 'Please for the love of our bountiful nation do not allow this to happen. I age and source all my cattle. This is a label that is adhered to the animal all the way through to harvest.

I am telling the consumer my food is safe to eat and it is of the utmost quality. Show me where that stamp is on imports! Our nation demands our goverment safeguards the public with a wholesome, abundant, affordable food supply that is produced by American\'s. With imports the goverment can not guarantee this right. A very wise man once told me"" John, You can not manage what you do not measure."" My question to you is just how does the USDA intend to measure food safety in a foreign country?  John J. Merrill  1338 CR 2310  Sulphur Springs, Tx. 75482-6893  817-832-5286', 'I agree with the idea of importation of beef from Brazil. In fact, I believe that this rule is necessary because it would be beneficial to consumers and buyers in the U.S. financially and would also stimulate the economy in Brazil as well, especially within the particular regions where the cattle are raised. International importation and exportation is beneficial to all countries involved. Both the producers of beef and consumers would realize gains in profit as well as an increase in capital and management welfare. According to page thirteen of the policy analysis given by APHIS, ""For all sectors, the net welfare change would be a gain of 0.02 percent, with consumer welfare gains of $354 million outweighing producer welfare losses of $165 million."" Furthermore, what people who disagree with this policy do not realize is how little this trade agreement would effect our own economy. David Harbour of Stinnett, Texas recently commented on the proposition saying, ""Allowing imports of fresh beef from Brazil into the U.S. is a bad idea because of risk of introducing diseases to the U S such as foot and mouth disease which would be catastrophic to the U S.""  Many people fail to realize the true extent of how much beef would actually be imported into the U.S. market. The policy analysis document that APHIS provides states that only three possible scenarios would take place if the policy were to be enacted, with them being either 20, 40, or 65,000 metric tons of Brazilian beef with 65,000 MT being the highest possible amount of beef allowed to be imported. However, in comparison to the roughly 12 million MT of beef produced in the U.S. annually, the impact of imported Brazilian beef into the market would be insignificant. The document then goes on to state that ""If the United States were to import 40,000 MT of beef from Brazil, total U.S. beef imports would increase by less than 1 percent."" Lastly, the government of Brazil itself has taken measures to rid their land of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) which is of primary concern to the APHIS agency. Since the mid-1990s, the programs instituted by the Brazilian government have made significant progress in lowering the risk of the disease being present, as the majority of the southern states (in particular the cattle-producing regions of Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraa) have observed little to no presence of FMD. In the event of an outbreak, Brazil has the capability and infrastructure to contain and stop it, and would also have to certify that the beef does not originate in any area that has been placed under restriction for FMD until 12 months after the last case in the area has been dealt with, according to the continuation policy that would be enforced by APHIS if such a case were to occur. Again, this policy would prove to be a positive one, benefitting both countries by lower U.S. beef prices and stimulating a developing Brazilian economy, while ensuring the quality and health of the meat given to the general public.', 'Subject: Docket APHIS-2009-0017  Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Larona Ganaway and I am submitting this comment to oppose the regulation changes that will allow the importation of chilled or frozen beef from the designated region in Brazil into the United States. This comment focuses on the risk of animal disease- foot-and-mouth (FMD) and swine fever. Also, concerns of the impact it may have on U.S. cattle groups, our markets and consumers if beef is imported from Brazil to the U.S. The question is will importing beef from Brazil be a burden rather than the problem resolver of the tight supplies of beef in the U.S.? Based on analysts imported Brazilian beef would not be enough to ease the tight supplies in the United States.   Foot and mouth disease and swine fever re highly contagious viral diseases of cloven-hoofed animals. They are both dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants and swine as stated in the background of the proposed rule. Section 94.1 of the regulations contains criteria for recognition by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of foreign regions as free of rinderpest or free of both rinderpest and FMD. Section 91.11 restricts the importation of ruminants and swine and their meat and certain their products from regions that are declared free of rinderpest and FMD but nonetheless present a disease risk because of the regions proximity to or trading relationships with regions affected with rinderpest or FMD. Although certain regions of Brazils beef is considered free of the ruminants and swine all of Brazil is not consider free of FMD. Brazil has had in the past outbreaks of FMD in 2000-2001 and 2005-2006. Although today there has not been any outbreak, however the safety of beef is still at risk.   The USDA should not approve imports of fresh Brazilian beef due to the risk of causing an outbreak.  Thank you for allowing me to comment.', '\uf0b7 -  The most recent outbreaks of FMD within the proposed export region in Brazil occurred in 2006. \uf0b7 -  USDA APHIS does not consider the countries of South America to be FMD-free with the exception of Chile. \uf0b7 -  Outbreaks of FMD have occurred in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, all countries that had been classified as FMD-free without vaccination or FMD-free with vaccination by the OIE prior to the FMD outbreaks.    ***These three points alone beg the question ""Why are we even seriously considering this?""   My operation has just recently recovered financially from the ""mad cow"" scares that we had a few years ago that shut off our export markets and decimated the cattle industry due to the sudden drop in prices that occurred and took far too long to recover from.  About the time we recovered from that, we\'ve had several years of recurring drought.  Now things have finally turned around for us and our government is thinking about undertaking what I consider to be a very risky move with very limited potential rewards. ***      -  The APHIS regulatory analysis highlights the possible consumer benefit from the import of 40,000 metric tons of fresh beef annually from Brazil but, fails to address the economic impact on consumers for the possible risk for the introduction of FMD virus to the United States and a resultant FMD outbreak \uf0b7 -  The risk to U.S. agriculture and to our cattle producers is far too great and the economic and animal health consequences far too significant to move forward with this proposed rule without first absolutely establishing that an attitude of willingness for compliance and a sophisticated infrastructure are present in Brazil to allow for the consistent performance of all FMD risk mitigation measures.      -  We cannot comfortably rely on a self-reporting system in Brazil to mitigate the U.S. risk for FMD.', ""I certainly do not wish to see Brazilian beef coming to the US as long as there is FMD in that country regardless of how small the risk of transmission might be.  The reason that the product is cheaper is because it is an inferior product to begin with and also because of the FMD risk other world economies do not want it either.  It is not our duty to serve as a dumping ground for this product.  Our domestic cattle producers have been through a difficult period with drought, blizzards, depressed cattle prices and inflated feed costs and they really don't need help from our government or Brazil to again depress prices when things are finally looking positive.

I\'d hate to say it\'s a safe practice and have it blow up in our face.   I agree with Dr. Arnold\'s assessment: ""I do not believe the gain to consumers in lower prices for beef outweighs the risk of introduction of Foot and Mouth disease into the United States. As recently as 2011, Paraguay reported two outbreaks of FMD type O in the San Pedro region in cattle approximately 250 miles from the Brazilian border. According to Brazilian officials, illegal movement of animals from neighboring countries as well as mechanical transmission of the virus can and has resulted in introduction of the disease. Even though the risk of introducing FMD to the US is low if all of the conditions are met as outlined in the proposed rule, the risk is still present and must be viewed in light of the devastation it would cause to the US beef industry if an FMD outbreak were to occur; especially in the area of export trade losses. Importation of fresh beef also allows an opportunity for agroterrorism as this provides an avenue to intentionally introduce a foreign animal disease. I believe it is not in the best interests of US agriculture to change a law originally issued to protect our industry only to lower the price of beef to consumers.  I am also concerned that by supporting the beef industry in Brazil, the United States is supporting an industry we know nothing about. We know nothing about their animal care standards, antimicrobial use, or their environmental protection issues. The US beef industry is working hard to produce standards of animal care, to minimize the use of antimicrobials, and to protect the environment in and around farms and ranches nationwide. By blindly supporting the Brazilian beef industry, we may be condoning the very practices we target as harmful in the United States.

Agriculture is of tantamount importance to our members.  Many of our rural communities depend heavily on a viable agricultural sector as an integral part of their economy.  We would like to register our comments in opposition to a change in  the regulations that would allow beef into the United States from Brazil. Although, exporting of agricultural products is a large sector of our economy, protecting that segment is important to continued growth and stabilization of our economy.  Allowing the importation of beef from Brazil would place an unfair burden upon our beef farmers.  The cost of production in Brazil has been documented to be lower than that of the United States.  This would allow Brazil to export their beef at a much lower price than beef that is produced in here.  By driving the price of beef down to an unsustainable price for our beef producers, this would cause a decline in those farmers and the potential loss of viable farm land.  It is also a well-documented fact that some of Brazilian cattle suffer from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).  FMD has not been documented in the United States since 1929.  Brazil has also failed to report that it has detected FMD within their beef cattle population.  There have also been other cattle diseases that have not been adequately reported that would cause severe harm to the United States cattle population.  The possibility of exposing our beef population to FMD or other diseases is not an acceptable situation.

Yet, the powerful, tiny magnets contained in the toys and other similar products that would be banned under the rule are not safe for children. These products have caused unnecessary surgeries, debilitating injuries, irreversible gastrointestinal damage and other lifelong health impacts in infants, children and adolescents.   Despite efforts by the CPSC to educate the public about the dangers of high-powered magnet sets and improvements in manufactures warning labels, recent data provide compelling evidence that warning labels are just not working. Magnet ingestions and the injuries they cause to childrenwhich can include bowel perforations or fistulas, twisted bowels and severe infections, among other serious gastrointestinal injuriesare preventable. The most effective way to prevent ingestions is to ban the sale of high-powered magnet sets, as defined in the proposed rule.     Children sometimes swallow things they shouldnt, but these magnets pose special risk to children. Unlike other commonly swallowed products like coins or marbles, when these high-powered magnets are swallowed, endoscopic or surgical intervention is required in nearly all cases to prevent bowel damage.   Magnet ingestions by children are no longer a rare occurrence. While manufacturers claim there have been few injuries from ingestion of magnets sold as part of their magnet desk toys, the experiences of pediatric gastroenterologists across the country who are treating children who have ingested high-powered magnets suggest otherwise.   Thank you for all you do for children.', ""I think that it's a shame to ban something outright under the guise of children's safety.

The ban is overly broad. There are two distinct hazard patterns that should be addressed: Children under 5 tounging their environment, and teenagers mimicking piercings.

Yes, certain magnets can be dangerous if used improperly, but then again, so can thousands of other products found in almost every home. The solution here is not for the government to over-regulate by banning what is a perfectly safe ADULT product, but rather to ensure that proper warnings are made with the product at the store and on the packaging. We don\'t need the government to act like strict parents and keep these products from us -- we need PARENTS to take responsiblilty for their own children\'s safety (by securing magnets the same way dangerous chemicals, pharmaceticals or even simple matches are), and EDUCATING their children on what is proper and what is not. People talk endlessly about our ""Nanny-state"" telling us what we can and cannot do -- and I usually dismiss such talk as overblown hyperbole. But in this case of banning certain MAGNETS simply  because kids might be injured -- because their parents have not properly done their own job -- I am now feeling that we may in fact be going down this road of just such a ""Nanny-state"". I urge the Commission to take step back, and look at this in the big picture -- such a rule is really an overstepping of the role of government.  If this rule passes, ANYTHING potentially dangerous could also be banned! Why not ban matches next?  They are very dangerous when kids get ahold of them.  Or what about various cleaning supplies? -- good lord, children die every year from poisonings, but the products themselves are not banned (instead, other COMMON-SENSE solutions are applied, like safety caps/containers, plus warnings, and the parents\' responsibility of securing the products AWAY FROM CHILDREN).

Magnets are highly fascinating, and quite fun to mess with.  While I do understand that they dangerous to children, the responsibility of reassuring their safety falls onto the parents and/or guardians of the children.  The companies who make such toys, and the magnets as a whole, should not be held accountable to the point where an entire ban should be imposed.  Also, the sales of such magnets should be restricted to ADULTS; in essence, persons who are at least the age of 18 or older; banning magnets is far too invasive.

But magnets and magnet sets are objectively not an unreasonable risk to anyone! A review of incident data from magnet injuries and an assessment of the proposed rulings likely effectiveness in reducing magnet injuries leads to the conclusion this proposed ruling is ineffective, bad for the economy, and likely to make matters worse as ignorance about magnet dangers remain prevalent.  A ban of magnet sets will not address the dangers of magnet ingestion. Tiny, powerful magnet ingestion injuries have been documented in the medical literature long before the introduction of magnet sets, as much as 4-years before magnet sets were invented! Small neodymium magnets are already very common in many swallowable consumer goods, including Lego products, fridge magnets, science kits and jewelry.  It is clear magnet injuries are mostly accidental, and occur as a result of consumer ignorance of magnet dangers. The prevalence of magnets in society will not go away even if magnet sets go away, and therefore the danger (and ignorance of the public) remains. We need medical practitioners trained and equipped to diagnose and treat magnet ingestions properly. This will reduce medical expenses and the need for more drastic medical interventions to resolve a magnet ingestion.  This proposed ruling does not consider the use of oral aversives or magnet safety practices that international markets have already successfully adopted. The proposed ruling also neglects the need for public and medical practitioner education related to magnet ingestion injuries. There is consensus in the medical community  education about magnet ingestion treatment and magnet dangers is desperately needed!

Set 4,"['To whom it may concern: I have loved elephants all my life, since I was a little girl, and I have learned much  about these wonderful and unique animals. Please consider the fact that elephants are large mammals who need a very large  space to be able to live an appropriate life. In a Zoo or Circus, the environment  does not meet that requirement. Also in a circus the elephant is subjected to methods  we would call cruel and  abusive. Elephants are herd animals, they have social needs which must be met for them  to have a meaningful and dignified life! Overall I believe that we must treat them with respect and refrain from hurting  them, locking them up in cages, isolating them from their own or mistreat them in  any way! They are innocent creatures at our mercy! We must educate ourselves to find out what the right thing is for them and then  DO THE RIGHT THING!', 'Elephants belong in groups and most zoos isolate them alone and do not have  sufficient space for their mental well being.  Also putting them in a circus to do  unnatural acts is cruel treatment to a wild animals.  Most trainers use beating and  harsh training for them to perform.  Repitious steps and acts demean the grand  creatures that they are.  If treated humanely and not having to travel and perform  constantly would be acceptable but that is not the case (most circus elephants  perform 11 months out of the year).  They are chained in their stalls and treated  roughly.  They do not belong in this enviornment.   The Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide elephants with  adequate space. Neither zoos nor circuses currently meet this requirement.  In too many zoos and circuses, elephants suffer not only from lack of space, but  from unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause a range of  preventable ailments ? including painful arthritis, foot disease, reproductive and  digestive disorders, and neurotic behaviors such as swaying and head bobbing.  An estimated half of all captive elephants suffer from arthritis and foot disease,  and these ailments are the leading cause of euthanasia in captive elephants.  Circus elephants are often subjected to prolonged chaining, spending up to 21  hours a day standing in chains and more than 11 months of the year traveling in  train boxcars, where they are again chained, and forced to endure extreme  temperatures and to stand for hours in their own waste. Many zoo elephants are  also subjected to prolonged chaining, and to confinement in barn stalls for  extended periods of time.   Circuses and many zoos control their elephants through force, domination, and  aggressive use of the bullhook and other tools of intimidation such as whips,  clubs, and electric shock devices. These instruments are unnecessary and must  be outlawed.   Exhibitors of elephants must be required to provide large, naturalistic  environments similar to those at The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the  Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) sanctuary in California.

I would like to see every elephant that is captive to be rehomed to a sanctuary or  wildlife preserve to live out their days with dignity and compassion with a herd in  the U.S.   No zoo should be allowed to keep an elephant unless their habitat is at  least 50-100 acres and they live in a group of FOUR (4).   No more elephants  should be bred or purchased for the zoo unless they have this kind of habitat in  their zoo.  Most zoos are too small.

These things have been known to cause considerable pain and  suffering to elephants.  2.

If regulations are not enforced,  then the those in breach are making a mockery of the importance of governmental  rule-making.  Prolonged use of bullhooks and chains should be investigated at the same time,  as adequate space is only a solution if the elephants are allowed to use it.  Use of instruments of force, including electric hotshots, are inhumane ways of  handling animals that are already mis-treated and hence are uncooperative.  Regulations to prevent this mistreatment would go a long way to making the  experiences of zoos and circuses more palatable and enjoyable - for both the  visitors and the star attractions.', 'There is a general lack of federal oversite on the living conditions of what we  generally refer to as wild animals.  That is just the point.  These animals are the  result of thousands of years of evolution which have led them to be successfully  adapted to a certain way of life.  Through our 19th century approach to such  creatures, we have negated their innate natures, forcing them to live in conditions  which are singularly inappropriate and therefore inhumane and cruel.  Elephants,  for example, are highly social, migrating creatures.  By forcing them to live in  limited spaces, which are often unhealthy (both mentally and physically) as well  as lacking in essential hygiene, we are creating the ideal circumstances for them  to exhibit inappropriate and often dangerous - to themselves, their caregiviers and  the general public - behaviors.   Keeping such animals in captivity is obviously motivated by financial gain, a  significant part of which involves limiting expenditures which would guarantee the  animal\'s wellbeing - even in less than optimal circumstances.  If their stated  purpose is indeed to familiarize the human population with animals outside their  normal scope of experience, then these animals need to be protected and offered  as close to ""natural"" conditions as possible.  Without strict federal oversite, this  will not occur. As the species living at the top of the evolutionary ladder, we have a responsbility  not to exploit, but to preserve less species from our depradations.  And by  insisting on adequate living conditions outside their normal habitat for these  animals, we are teaching our chirldren and all future generations an important  lesson about life and responsibility. I therefore very strongly support strict federal guidelines and enforcement of  adequate living conditions for captive animals - in this particular case, elephants.', '# Zoos and circuses do not provide elephants with the conditions they require for their health and well-being. # The Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide elephants with adequate space.

Under existing standards, elephants in zoos and circuses have suffered and continue to  suffer severe, life-shortening pain and distress. They are excessively confined, housed in facilities  that cause and contribute to injuries, and subjected to cruel punishment.  Existing standards permit these deprivations of elephant welfare.

Thank you for your consideration.', ""I strongly feel there is a critical need to immediately terminate elephants living in  zoos and circuses. Their health, especially foot problems, is becoming  catastrophic. Since the AWA requires zoos and circuses provide elephants with  adequate living space, why isn't this being strongly enforced? Any intelligent  person can readily see there is a problem at zoos. The concrete surfaces are  brutal on elephant's feet and also contribute to severe arthritic conditions over  time. Zoos and circuses routinely house the elephants in close quarters at night  and during bad weather. This only makes the problems worse....they simply  cannot move around! As you well know, elephants are highly social animals and  have always lived together in herds. To have one or two elephants confined simply  for paying spectators to look at is basic animal abuse and the zoos/circuses know  it, but whether they will admit it is another matter. Why not require zoos to have  HUGE areas for large groups to roam or simply have the elephants moved to  approved sanctuaries?  This is not unreasonable. As for circuses, it is high time  that it be made unlawful for elephants to travel in these archaic conditions. Please  consider requiring elephant's living areas be substantially increased where they will  be allowed to roam as they have for centuries in the wild."", ""The attrocious conditions that exist for elephants living in Zoo's and other animal  viewing areas is rephrehensive and must be brought to an immediate halt. The  Zoo's must be required to provide adequate dirt park like areas to eliminate the  horrible and inhumane medical conditions of these beloved animals or the Zoo's  must be required to transfer all elephants to appropriate Sanctuaries, Where the  elephants can live in environments more suitable and similar to their native habitat  and recieve proper medical treatment for their ailments. Historically most  elephants will respond rapidly to the new conditions and be able to live a normal  life expectancy.

Read this story on PTSD from the N.Y. Times  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/magazine/08elephant.html Elephants exhibit swaying the head and shoulders, even the whole body, from side to side when confined.

If I were to make someone perform ?circus? acts, such as  standing on his or her head, or to keep them confined as a live prop on display this  is ""forced labor"", better known as  ?slavery?.

Yet these forms of dominance are  forced on elephants in zoos and circuses. A wild animal is NEVER domesticated. Even at the wonderful Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, a caregiver was killed  this summer by an elephant she was caring for due to the animals horrible past  memories. The elephant later showed signs of remorse. I strongly ask that all zoos and circuses or any venue using elephants have their  permits/licenses pulled and allow the remaining elephants to be sent to an  accredited sanctuary and furthermore, no more breeding of elephants in the United  States.

Elephants require far more space than other wild animals. They cannot live on hard surfaces such as concrete, as their weight puts too much stress on their joints, resulting in joint problems. After all, concrete does not occur in nature. Wild elephants live with their family members and bond with other elephants for years, so captive elephants should never be forced to live alone or be separated from elephants with whom they have bonded for years. Elephants should not be forced to live in cold weather, so if northern zoos cannot provide a natural heated environment during winter, perhaps northern zoos should not be permitted to keep elephants during cold weather.  The behaviors that zoos force elephants to perform are ridiculous and should simply be banned. Elephants in nature do not wear clothes, balance on two legs, perform tricks, wear leg chains, or travel in small enclosures for hours in all kinds of weather.

By developing a strict enforcement code for the care of  elephants in this country we will ensure humane treatment for these magnificent  animals.  I believe there is sufficient well-documented research showing exactly  what environment elephants need to maintain their health and well-being.  Zoos  and circuses do not provide the conditions that elephants require.  The well  publicized example of the Detroit Zoo abandoning its elephant exhibit and  relocating their two elephants to the sanctuary in California demonstrates how  enlightened and knowledgeable experts view the inhumane conditions currently  used to house elephants.  While we applaud the Detroit Zoo Director\'s decision,  there are still too many elephants left to endure a miserable life without the basic  needs of their species. I?ve recently returned from a trip to South Africa and Zimbabwe where I observed  many elephants in their natural environment.  Certainly a spectacular sight to  witness up to 100 elephants congregating at a water hole or a family unit of 6  swimming in the Zambezi, it is obvious to even the most casual observer that  these animals require large tracts of land to feed, roam, socialize, mate and  survive.  Since elephants in the U.S. can never live the life of a wild elephant, they  MUST be protected from cruel and inhumane treatment while also receiving the  proper care along with an enriched environment.  Our Government must provide the  necessary oversight to ensure that the regulations regarding elephant care and  treatment are strictly enforced.

The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Humans are called to be compassionate caregivers, protectors and stewards of the planet and its beings. Helping not harming. To create an environment  where all beings are treated with respect and compassion. Never to die needlessly or cruelly. These vulnerable, innocent beings have the right to live ""cruelty-free"" in peace.   Humans, believing to be superior, must use their superior intellect to research other options.

""We must remember in our dealings with animals that they are a SACRED TRUST to us.  They cannot speak for themselves."" Harriet Beecher Stowe  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', ""Our family has had the privilege to have participated in three separate encounters with Dolphin Quest.  Each of these experiences were in the Islands of Hawaii.  We were impressed with the companies treatment of our family and our children's experience too.  Most importantly they had the animals well being and health as a priority.  As adults my children look fondly back on that interaction as an educational experience.  You could tell that the employees cared about the animals and had a personal mission to provide the best care.  In those encounters we had safety instructions on how to interact in the animals best interest.  We witnessed during the week at the Hotel the dolphins having free play time and did not observe any negative interaction.  If these types of experiences do not exist for the public we will lose the ability to connect the future generations to the needs of these animals.  Being close to the dolphins triggered many meal conversations regarding how we can protect them and help the wild populations.  I am not a employee of this company nor know anyone who works there personally.  Please help them stay in business doing good for both Marine animals and Humans. "", ""It is impossible to humanely keep marine mammals in captivity. Rules and regulations can lessen the negative impact on the animals but they cannot make the captive conditions humane. Keeping these animals in captivity is akin to keeping a condor in a cage. Even a large tank, a salt water pond, lake, or lagoon will be but a drop in the world these animals naturally inhabit. They will not encounter, meet, or have the opportunity to form new relationships with new acquaintances nor will they have the opportunity to break off the ones forced upon them in a captive setting. Novelty is essentially nonexistent in a captive setting.   The recent change in perspective on the way chimpanzees would have to be maintained in captivity in order to approximate an ethnologically appropriate environment is germane to any discussion about the appropriateness of a captive environment for marine mammals. An honest evaluation of the needs of chimpanzees led the NIH to recognize that the minimum standards needed to achieve a semblance of a humane environment meant that it would essentially be impossible to hold them in a setting that allowed close observation and manipulation of those animals.   The physical space needed to provide marine mammals a humane captive environment may be impossible to manage in a commercial setting; it may be impossible altogether. I urge the Agency to revisit the matter and to look at the issue without concern for the financial costs to exhibitors. Engineering standards for enclosures and care that meet the animals' physical and psychological needs should be the only concern in the promulgation of rules and regulations governing their care and confinement."", 'This past summer we visited Dolphin Quest and stayed for a week at the Khahala Resort on Oahu.

I am very lucky to have the opportunity to educate hundreds of guests everyday. My first memory of explaining how wonderful the aquarium is, was when a guest looked into Ocean Voyager and asked if the Whale Shark was sad swimming in circles all day. I told them that in fact, we have FOUR whale sharks, who live in that habitat, and that they free swim. When they asked what that meant, I told them that the habitat is so big, that our Whale Shark experts haven't been able to track a swimming pattern and they seem to be content, which means that they are acting as they would in their natural habitat. They were blown away. I also went further to explain how whale fin soup is made, and how Georgia Aquarium is one of the foremost leaders in making Whale Shark hunting illegal.  The fact that the aquarium has so many different animals and trainers that care for them blows me away.  I started working here as an Atmostphere Performer, and now I am studying to become a marine mammal trainer. I hadn't had the opportunity to see a dolphin, seal, beluga, or sea lion until I started working here. I loved learning about how well these animals have thrived in Human Care.

Dolphin Quest is proud to uphold the highest standards of care for our animals.  Our animals are well-loved and well-cared for.  Through my experience, I have seen these animals touch the hearts and minds of people of all ages from all over the world through interactive programs.  They inspire conservation and empower those that they meet to make a difference to help their wild counterparts and their ocean home.    I am fortunate to have been able to form a strong bond with these animals.  Through these relationships, we are able to learn from one another.  These animals' lives are very enriching, filled with play, learning and mental and physical stimulation.  This is a true sanctuary for them.  Because of the strong bonds that we have formed with our animals, I feel as if it is most beneficial for us to spend our days with them, enriching their lives rather than having to focus on managing additional superfluous regulations.

Recently, there has been a lot of research using very advanced tagging technology to monitor movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially polar bears. They found that a lot of these species travel large distances and dive deeper than people thought which makes the current minimum space requirements way to small. Science also now says that sea lions, seals, and sea otters also need a lot more space. The space standard was set over 30 years ago and have no supporting scientific evidence supporting it. For example, the Orcas, (killer whales) have a space that has a diameter twice as wide and a depth that's half as deep as an average adult orca is long. An Orca wouldn't be able to even position itself vertically if it wanted to because its tail would be touching the bottom.  \tAlso, standards that were set have been bent quite a bit. For example, the standard interaction time with dolphins went from 2 hours a day to 3 hours without any scientific facts supporting that decision. Also I believe there should be noise standards. For example, at Sea World, there is firework shows directly over the marine mammal enclosures. There are also massive amounts of cheering and screaming during hours of business there. Overall, I believe that we need to realize that marine mammals are not meant to be kept as pets for entertainment, but if society absolutely must need this type of entertainment, then we should give these beautiful creatures a home that more resembles a home, not a prison."", 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals.

Regarding marine mammals on display at theme parks - and NOISE -  I would ask you to go to a casino with many loud slot machines and music blaring and see how long you would wish to inhabit that space. These marine mammals have no choice in loud theme parks. The constant noise ""in season"" of roller coasters and music blaring must be incredibly stressful.  I have watched orcas ""head lobbing"" before a performance, dragging their tail flukes on the bottom of a cement pool...because the pool is not even as deep as they are long.

There are several reasons I believe the risk is too high for introduction of FMD from Brazilian beef.  Although there are regions of Brazil that are deemed free and have been deemed free from foot and mouth disease for some time we also know other regions are not.  We know Brazil has used a combination of vaccination, quarantines, stop movements, etc to control the disease howver we do not know how close the disease is to cattle in the deemed free zones.  It certainly is unclear  that the seperation zone is adequate in Brazil to provide absolute assurance that airborne and vector spread will not occur.  Vaccination for FMD is a standard practice in Brazil and we have no idea if animals were not vaccinated if the disease would come back.  Because Brazil continues to vaccinate for FMD I believe it shows that they are not comfortable in their own risk assesments or preventative measures.  Why should the United States trust their system when its clear they are not comfortable stopping the practice of vaccinating for FMD?    I believe that we need absolute assurance that the product arriving in United States would have no risk in bringing live virus to our country.   Deboned beef as a commodity is likely low risk in harboring live virus however we do not have studies or models that conclude the risk is negligible enough that we risk our nations beef supply.  The OIE itself does not know what the risk would be and says so in its 2009 report.  It would be my recommendation that the US not import beef from a country that has been endemic with FMD for many years until risk assesments, models, and further science proves the risk to be negligible.', ""As a cattle raiser in NE Texas I am strictly opposed to importation of beef from any country that does not control diseases in their animals that may be transmitted to our beef supply here in the U.S.  Our country has worked hard to control diseases in our food supply and therefore our prices for our beef here in the US reflect that.

There is no good reason why we would knowingly import the FMD pathogen into the US, doing so could cost US cattle producers and the US economy millions of dollars. The US has been free of FMD since the 1920's. If anything we should be ensuring FMD is not introduced and strengthen our import restrictions by not allowing beef imports from Uruguay (also a FMD state). We are blessed to have not been impacted by FMD from Uruguay, why would we want to push our luck? We should not be importing potentially infected beef into the US.

I strongly urge USDA/APHIS to rescind this proposed rule.  In the proposed rule APHIS admits there is a minimal risk of introducing FMD to the USA.  This is of no comfort to me as in the past USDA /APHIS has said there was a minimal risk of FMD in South Korea, Japan, South Africa and Argentina and within a very short period time in some case as little as  6 months these countries had an epidemic out break of FMD which involved the mass slaughter of millions of livestock and wildlife.  The Department of Homeland Security has spent billions of dollars to prevent terrorism in the USA so why would another department of the United States Government want to invite the risk of economic genocide to not only the livestock industry of the United States but the entire economy of the USA.  To allow fresh and chilled beef from Brazil, a country known to have FMD, is taking a foolish risk  that could very easily result in the introduction of FMD to the USA. In the event FMD were introduced in the USA it would cause economic ruin and devastation to all industries in the USA as all commerce would shut down tourism included. All we have to do is look back to what happened in Great Brittan around the turn of the century.   FMD is a disease that is highly contagious and very difficult to contain. The disease can be carried on the wind on a humid day up to sixty miles. The incubation period for the FMD is 14 days with 3 days to confirm meanwhile the disease is spreading.  The way that livestock move in commerce it would be nearly impossible to contain.  The best defense the USA can have is to keep fresh, chilled beef and cloven hoofed livestock from entering the USA from countries known to have FMD and countries that border FMD infected countries.  Brazil and other countries that have FMD can export meat to the USA if it is cooked for the appropriate time and temperature so people on low incomes will be afford to buy canned and cooked meat. So to say that the USA needs to import fresh and chilled beef to help low income people afford beef is not necessarily true.    I think it is high time that USDA/ APHIS started protecting the US livestock industry from disease as it mission statement says instead of continually trying to appease the interests of foreign governments and their meat packer allies.', 'Why would you, the USDA, want to jeopardize the herds here in America, and our beef farmers ways of life? This is not only a unsafe health risk, but also a financial hit to our already slumping economy.

At a time when some of the cattlemen in this country are trying to rebuild herds due to Blizzards or drought, this will only drive down the prices of the US production.', 'The South Dakota Stockgrowers Association strongly opposes the adoption of this proposed rule to allow 14 states in Brazil to export fresh and chilled beef to the United States based on risk of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) contamination in the United States, and negative impacts to the United States beef market.  The South Dakota Stockgrowers Association (SDSGA) was founded in 1893 and since that time our mission has remained unchanged, to promote and protect the South Dakota livestock industry.  Today we represent over 1,000 ranch families in South Dakota.  On behalf of those members and inline with our mission, we ask for consideration of the following points:  1.\tFMD is the most contagious disease known to animals like cattle, sheep, hogs and deer. FMD is endemic in South America and USDAs own analysis concludes that, there is a risk of reintroduction from adjacent areas into the proposed exporting region.""  SDSGA cannot support opening of these Brazilian markets when a risk of FMD is prevalent.  USDAs analysis of border security in Brazil and disease control through the ports of export does not satisfy our concerns that FMD remains a serious risk. No risk of FMD introduction to the United States is acceptable.  Additionally, USDA has not included a potential introduction of FMD to the United States into their cost analysis.  Controlling, managing and recovering from an FMD outbreak in our country would be nearly impossible for the independent livestock producers that we represent. 2.\tUSDA admits that imports of cheap Brazilian beef will harm U.S. cattle producers. USDA states, ""The fall in beef prices and resulting decline in U.S. production would translate into reduced returns for producers in the livestock and beef processing sectors.""   USDA\'s economic model estimates U.S. cattle producers will be harmed by as much as $316 million per year.  SDSGA is seriously concerned about the impact that this will have on U.S. cow/calf and smaller feedlot producers while the packing industry will only benefit from the purchase of cheaper products.  We cannot support USDAs implementation of a rule that will negatively impact the independent producers of the U.S.   At the same time, Brazil imports only a negligible amount of beef and is not expected to import any significant volumes of U.S. beef.  Meaning that the risk of both market impacts and disease outbreak do not carry any benefit for U.S. producers.  3.\tFinally, SDSGA strongly urges USDA to extend the comment period for this rule.  Given the gravity of this rule and the serious potential impact to the United States cattle industry, USDA would be prudent to take a slow and measured approach to consideration of comments and further analysis of this proposal before moving forward.  We intend to submit more thorough comments regarding the impact of this proposed rule if we are allowed more time for consideration and explanation.  Thank you for your time and consideration of our comments.  At this time we reiterate our opposition to this proposed rule and encourage USDA to either repeal this proposal or at the minimum, extend the comment period for consideration.

It\'s a travesty that with the  knowledge that we now have about how these magnificent creatures are meant to live, that we  continue to deny them humane treatment. <p>  For their health and well-being, elephants need to walk, roam, and graze.

Elephant Course, Seattle, August 3, 1998 <p>  ""Long periods of inactivity can and will be detrimental to the health and longevity of an elephant.  To an animal that is programmed to move eighteen out of twenty-four hours, inactivity has a high  price. Normally, the nail and foot tissue of an elephant is worn down during the long hours of  walking over different substrates. Flexibility to wrist, knees and their joints is increased and  maintained by the continuous movement of their daily activities. Foot problems, if not caused by  injury, trauma or arthritic conditions of joints, are the end product of inadequate movement and  activity. An elephant\'s foot will regenerate normally without elaborate pedicures, providing an  exercise regime of mass movement and daily walks is sustained throughout the elephant\'s life.  If an abscess develops and the elephant is maintained in an inadequate care system, re- infection will occur until the infection has reached the toe digits and surgery is need. Very few of  these cases survive."" - Alan Roocroft, consultant who has worked with captive elephants for over 30 years <p>  When I began my zoo career 35 years ago, much less was known about elephants than is  known today. We now understand that keeping elephants in tiny enclosures with unnatural  surfaces destroys their legs and feet. We have learned that to breed naturally and rear their  young, elephants must live in herds that meet their social requirements. And we have come to  realize that controlling elephants through domination and the use of ankuses (sharply pointed  devices used to inflict pain) can no longer be justified. - Les Schobert has been a curator at major zoos, including in Los Angeles and North  Carolina.<p>', ""Elephant deaths are a matter of physics   Chicago Sun Times Letter to Editor by Les Golden  The death of two elephants at the Lincoln Park Zoo should come as no surprise.  While it is obvious that cold weather is bad for species that have evolved in  tropical climates, understanding the death-inducing effect of confinement to  concrete cells requires a rudimentary knowledge of physics (I have taught  astronomy at the University of Illinois at Chicago).  When animals take a step in their natural, sod environment, the concussion felt  when the foot lands is muffled. When walking on concrete or pavement, no such  effect occurs. This is why shoes are cushioned, and special running shoes are  manufactured for those foolhardy enough to run on streets.  The damaging effects exceed the obvious orthopedic ones. The concussive effect  is proportional to the weight of the body. For massive animals such as the  elephant, the effect is horrendous and is easily calculated. It can amount to three  times the weight of the body. For a 5-ton elephant, that is a force of 15 tons -- as  if the weight of seven automobiles is slammed into the body. Mammal bodies are  composed largely of water, an incompressible fluid. When that force hits the  elephant's body, the concussion is transmitted through the legs, and upward  through all the organs of the body.  The cells of those organs are ruptured. This occurs notably among the delicate  cells of the alveoli of the lungs. That is the source of the well-documented  prevalence of deaths due to tuberculosis, a disease of the lungs, among captive  elephants and other large mammals. As the many organs in the body necessary  for digestion are also damaged, emaciation is also a common occurrence.  Damage to brain tissues results in dementia. Ruptured capillaries results in  internal bleeding and anemia. All result from the continual concussive effects of  3G (three times the force of gravity) deceleration. It is as if the elephant  experiences hundreds of minor automobile accidents each day.  Confinement of large mammals such as the rhinoceros, elephant, giraffe and  buffalo to concrete cells is a death sentence. After the first elephant death, the  Chicago City Council ignored the plea of actress Gillian Anderson to pass a  resolution asking for the return of the two surviving elephants to more suitable  locations.  As for the administrators of Lincoln Park Zoo, they may not have understood the  physics, but after the death of one elephant, they should have put ticket sales  behind animal welfare in their priorities. Sadly for the elephants, they chose not to.  Leslie M. Golden,  Oak Park  http://www.suntimes.com/output/letters/cst-edt-vox28a.html     He further writes:  Here's the physics.  The formula for acceleration is (v - w) / T, where w is the initial  velocity, v is the final velocity, and T is the time interval for the change.  It is  reasonable to assume the velocity of an elephant's foot as it steps to be about 2  feet/second.  When cushioned by sod, it takes about 1 second for the foot to  come to rest, that is, for a zero velocity to be attained.  That leads to an  acceleration of (0 - 2)/1 = -2 feet/second-second.  This compares to 32.2  feet/second-second acceleration of gravity.  This is a mild deceleration, easily  tolerated by the body, which has evolved over millions of years under that  moderate stress level. If that elephant step, however, is onto concrete, the time interval for the change of  velocity is only the fraction of a second needed for the elephant's foot pads to be  compressed.  This is between 0.1 and 0.05 seconds.  The deceleration is then   (0 - 2)/0.1 to (0 - 2)/0.05 or  20 feet/second-second to 40 feet/second-second.   After years of confinement, the pads lose their resiliency, so that the time interval  is reduced to 0.02 second.  That yields a deceleration of 100 feet/second-second.   That is three times the acceleration of gravity, and the well-known correspondence  of w = m g  yields a force equal to three times the weight of the elephant quoted  above."", ""I am writing to express my support of dramatic improvements in enforcement and  the standards for captive elephants. Zoos and circuses are not giving elephants  the conditions they require for their good health and well-being.  Anyone with an  iota of common sense knows that elephants are large animals that require a lot of  space. Too many zoos provide a severe lack of space, unnatural conditions and  social deprivation that eventually causes a range of preventable problems, from  arthritis and foot disease to neurotic behavior such as swaying and head bobbing.   In captivity, elephants rarely reach their anticipated life span of 70 years in the  wild. From 2000 to the present, 47 elephants perished inside facilities accredited  by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) ? including Lincoln Park,  Birmingham, Gladys Porter, San Francisco, Disney's Animal Kingdom,  Columbus, Hogle, San Antonio, Houston, Los Angeles, Busch Gardens, Oregon,  Rosamond Gifford Brookfield, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Jackson, Six Flags  Marine World, Dickerson Park, Bronx, Have Trunk Will Travel, North Carolina,  Point Defiance, River Banks, El Paso, Milwaukee, Denver, Omaha's Henry Doorly,  St. Louis, and National Zoos.   At least half died before the age of 40. Some facilities lost a number of elephants  in recent years.  Zoos, circuses, and other commercial venues are plainly unequipped to meet the  complex physical/psychological needs of elephants. A simulated environment  cannot replicate the wild where African elephants span a 120-square mile home  range and walk at least 5.5 miles daily. Asian elephants cover up to 200 square  miles and roam 5-14 miles everyday.   Conversely, the AZA requires 1800 square feet per elephant. That's just .04 acres  (compared to 640 acres in a single square mile) and roughly the dimension of six  parking spaces.  I fully support the citizen's petition from In Defense of Animals (IDA) that calls for  enforcement of the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) at zoos and circuses. In  fact, an ongoing lack of space, exercise, and social enrichment demonstrates the  USDA's failure to uphold an AWA provision requiring zoos and circuses to  maintain settings consistent with the welfare of elephants.  IDA's petition also rightfully asks the USDA to seize elephants suffering from  captivity-provoked infirmities. An estimated 50% endure chronic arthritis and foot  abscesses from insufficient exercise and endless hours upon hardened surfaces.  Some elephants succumb to zoochosis, a type of psychological distress, and  tuberculosis also spreads among elephants in captivity.   I strongly urge the USDA to demand compliance with the AWA, either through  expanding environments to encompass hundreds of acres or by relocating  elephants to free-range sanctuaries where they can move in groups, swim in  watering holes, and indulge in dust baths.  No manufactured exhibit, even those considered innovative or optimally  maintained, can emulate the natural world.   Thank you,"", ""The general living conditions for elephants held captive in North America zoos can be described as  dismal at best.   Current USDA rules and regulations leave major components of space and  housing requirements open to the interpretation of zoo administrators.  The USDA should  REQUIRE at least two acres per animal, that the animal live in a climate as close to possible as  it's natural habitat (i.e. why does Tiger Haven, a USDA licensed facility,  in Jacksonville, Florida  have 2 ARTIC foxes living outdoors?), and extensive enrichment opportunities.   Zoos should be  REQUIRED, not recommended, to have at least three elephants if they have any at all."", 'When an animal cannot be kept healthy or sane, then that animal must be  removed from its situation.  If that disturbs a business or a livelihood, it is  justified.     When elephants are kept in captivity, they, like all living beings, have specific  needs.  If they are not given access to ample living space, proper climate, food,  water and natural ground, they are going to suffer hardship.   Keeping elephants in miserly conditions does nothing to improve their  condition in the wild, zoo propaganda to the contrary.     I am in favor of any ENFORCED rulings that would improve life for captive  elephants.

These beautiful, intelligent and loving animals deserve so much better than confinment, abuse and exploitation. There was a recent article published on how elephants are beginning to relate to human beings as dangerous and hostile enemies. The article suggests that these animals are beginning to ""fight back"" from being killed by poachers, abused and exploited by heartless humans. Elephants have a highly socialized and altruistic community structure which requires space and opportunity to live in their natural environment. One of the key elements in an altruistic social structure is the ability to remember who is generous and helpful within the group and who is not. It makes sense that elephants would begin to remember who in the larger community behaves that way too. While they are adaptable, these confined conditions are not optimal for their needs and can sometimes lead to much suffering. As so many animals are becoming extinct everyday, I think it is worth taking a look at how we treat the most useful and friendly species on earth. We are already pushing so many animals off the land, we should make room for the elephants and treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve.', 'The Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide elephants with  adequate space. Neither zoos nor circuses currently meet this requirement.  In too many zoos and circuses, elephants suffer not only from lack of space, but  from unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause a range of  preventable ailments ? including painful arthritis, foot disease, reproductive and  digestive disorders, and neurotic behaviors such as swaying and head bobbing. An  estimated half of all captive elephants suffer from arthritis and foot disease, and  these ailments are the leading cause of euthanasia in captive elephants.  Circus elephants are often subjected to prolonged chaining, spending up to 21  hours a day standing in chains and more than 11 months of the year traveling in  train boxcars, where they are again chained, and forced to endure extreme  temperatures and to stand for hours in their own waste. Many zoo elephants are  also subjected to prolonged chaining, and to confinement in barn stalls for  extended periods of time.  Circuses and many zoos control their elephants through force, domination, and  aggressive use of the bullhook and other tools of intimidation such as whips,  clubs, and electric shock devices. These instruments are unnecessary and must  be outlawed.

These two  refuges provide hundreds to thousands of acres over which elephants can roam,  socialize and maintain their health.', 'On August 28, 2006, I visited the Carson and Barnes Circus in my hometown of  Watertown, NY.  I was motivated to visit the circus, before and during the show,  and to bring my digital camera, because I had learned that the circus uses means  of animal cruelty, especially regarding the elephants, so that the animals will  perform tricks.  I find this type of behaviour utterly appalling and believe that it  must come to a complete stop.  Around 11 o\'clock am, I drove by the circus.   Four elephants were out in an unshaded yard.  I returned at 1:30 pm and walked  around the grounds, paying particularly close attention to the elephants.  The  elephants suprisingly stayed within a small patch of the yard, and were  surrounded by metal poles connected by wire.  It is only my educated hypothesis  that these wires were electric; there would be no other way to keep four elephants  within that small radius.  In the elephant yard was a man reading a book.  As I  watched two of the elephants touch and hold each other\'s trunks, the man looked  up and yelled at the elephants, discouraging any type of social interaction  between the animals.  I observed the elephants at the closest distance I felt was  possible, and found that there were dark marks on one of the elephant\'s sides (to  which the man later referred to as ""shit stains""), and what seems to be some sort  of indent on another elephant\'s upper front left shoulder.  As I am no expert on  elephants or animal health, it is unclear to me whether or not these are scars from  electric rods or hooks, but I felt it was necessary to photograph anything I felt was  unusual.  I do know however, that, according to United States law, all circus  animals must be provided with shade.  When I questioned the man about the fact  that, 2 1/2 hours later, the elephants still did not have any shade, he  responded that whatever type of shade the elephants are usually provided with  was broken, and was being fixed.  The high temperature for the day in Watertown  was 79 degrees Fahrenheit.  If the elephants could not have had their shade fixed  in 2 1/2 hours, an arrangement for makeshift shade should have been  taken care of.  There was also no water for the elephants.  The man said they had  been recently watered, but I have read on websites concerning elephants in  circuses (particularly Carson and Barnes) that said that the elephants are not  given water a few days before a performance so that they will not urinate during  tricks.  I also photographed the outside and inside of the elephant trailers, which  the man had said holds two elephants.  I found the length and width of the trailers  to be shockingly small, with barely enough room for the elephants to lay down or  turn around.  The trailers that were provided for the human actors were much  larger than those provided for the animals.  Because I was scheduled to work, I  was not able to return to the circus until 8 o\'clock pm.  There was still no shade  provided for the elephants.  While the temperature was cooler at this time, the  other animals in the circus continued to have shade.  I cannot see any reason for  the circus to assemble the shade for the elephants and then take the time remove  it when the air becomes cool. I observed the elephants again, and this time saw  red bands around their legs.  I assume this was part of their costumes.  I feel  guilty for having paid for a ticket to support this torturous lifestyle the elephants  live in, but I felt that it was necessary if I wanted to document and expose any  type of cruel behaviours towards the animals. Some of the pictures I took show  some sort of stick the trainers were using when the elephants were performing,  and others are of the cruel tricks the elephants were forced to do.  The one I find  most appalling involves an elephant laying on the ground and having the two other  elephants sit on it\'s head and back.  Elephants are most certainly not known for  their light weight. PETA wrote to Watertown\'s city council asking them to forbid Carson and Barnes  from performing in Watertown, and showed the council the video of the elephants  being treated cruelly during training sessions. I am embarrassed to say that the  city council did not comply. Please help these elephants and stop the torture they endure during their life.  Many are born, bred and live in a setting where they are frequently abused by the  use of bullhooks, and are shocked with electric rods when they are too tired or too  scared to perform tricks. They are kicked, screamed at or chained, and are forced  to do unnatural and painful things for a few minutes of human entertainment. This  is their entire life.

Don't let ignorance change that true."", ""As an employee in operations currently at Dolphin Quest Hawaii, and a participant in programs at Dolphin Quest, Sea World, and other facilities like them, I can honestly say that the need for APHIS to increase regulation, and the concern APHIS has over the well being and safety of our animals, is unwarranted.  Here at Dolphin Quest it is quite clear that the safety and health of the animals is the top priority. From the top down, owners, management, training and front of house guest services, every single member of our team is committed and deeply invested in the welfare of our dolphins. I can attest to this as an employee, working with our wonderful training staff, but I can also attest to this as a participant and former visitor to places such as Dolphin Quest Hawaii.  As a university student at UCSB studying environmental science, caught up in the animal rights movement, I was on the fence about whether or not keeping animals like these under human care was helpful or not. I wondered as stewards of our earth, if as people we were doing the right thing. My sophomore year of college I visited DQ Hawaii and really got to talk in depth with the training staff here about what they do, how they do it, and most importantly why they do it. It was abundantly clear, as a visitor, that the training staff was of the highest quality, and that the dolphins were well loved and well cared for. It was also very clear, that facilities like Dolphin Quest are keystone pieces in influencing people to WANT to protect these animals.  So many people come to places like Sea World and Dolphin Quest that have never seen the ocean, much less seen a whale or dolphin. These interactive experiences are what really changes peoples minds. It's one thing to watch it on the Discovery channel or National Geographic, its another thing to be in the water, face to face with these amazing creatures.  What people don't seem to understand, even among the educated, is that without these kinds of experiences, how would you feasibly see one of these animals? How would you come to appreciate them? If it wasn't for zoos and aquariums, people would wouldn't know what a polar bear was, wouldn't know what a panda looks like, or a walrus, or a dolphin, or a beluga. These animals are next to impossible to see in the wild for the average human. And yet the average human can come face to face with a dolphin in the lagoon here at Dolphin Quest.   So, as an employee of Dolphin Quest, and as a kid who immigrated from a port city in Taiwan, to a small surf town in California, who grew up loving the ocean and loving these animals, I urge you to think about the facts.   Use the science at your disposal.  We both know that many of these stipulations in the new documents are not driven by scientific fact, and are merely assumptions made in the face of public pressure from a few outspoken sources. Places like Dolphin Quest and Sea World are not the enemy. Their interactive programs are incredibly enriching, for both the animals and the humans. Their trainers are top notch, experienced and dedicated. Simply put, they are the best. The decision to add additional regulation, to tie both the trainers hands and decrease interaction and stimulation of animals, is one that would be extremely negligent, and completely unnecessary.   Thank you for your time, and for considering my words. I know as an agency you will make the right decision for the well being of not only our animals, but also for the well being of our future generations.

I hold memberships with the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association), AZA (Association of Zoos and Aquariums), IMATA (International Marine Animal Trainers Association), IAAAM (International Association of Aquatic Animal Medicine), BVA (British Veterinary Association), and WAVMA (World Aquatic Veterinary Medical Association). In addition, I will become a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons following my graduation in July of this year. I have had the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the regulations and would like to submit the below comments for consideration.  I am in firm agreement with the proposed regulations regarding ventilation, as marine mammals can be particularly prone to respiratory illnesses. The threat of viral, fungal, and bacterial infections is far more pertinent than objectionable odours.    I am also in agreement regarding proposed regulations for shade in outdoor enclosures. Marine mammals are prone to certain ophthalmic diseases and specific neoplasias which are more likely following lengthy exposure to UV-light.  After performing a thorough literature search, I am unable to find peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for time constraints on interactive programming, or how such regulation would benefit marine mammals. I do support an increase in the amount of interactive programming (i.e. from 2 to 3 hours per day), however I struggle to support the overall notion that interactive sessions must not exceed 'x' hours per day per animal. It is my opinion that interactive programming itself is of benefit to the animals, as it provides a multitude of sensory and cognitive enrichment. Programming should be limited, however, if an individual animal demonstrates a specific need (e.g. neonates, pregnant or lactating females, ill animals, etc). This specific need should be assessed and determined by a qualified veterinarian.  Limiting interaction could decrease the amount of cognitive stimuli available for the animals. Many, if not all, of marine mammal interactive programs in the United States utilize classical and operant conditioning techniques based on positive reinforcement. A critical component of this is that the animals are provided with the opportunity to voluntarily participate in training sessions and interactive programming, and likewise are provided with the opportunity to refuse participation, if they so choose. The animals, therefore, regulate the amount of time they spend in interactive programs themselves; training staff simply provide them with multiple opportunities to participate throughout the day. (The inclusion of the 'buffer' areas could potentially benefit this concept further.)  I am in support of regulations that enhance the enclosure environments, or increase the amount of environmental enrichment available to the animals throughout the day. For example, regulations about the amount of shade provided to animals in enclosures, or that animals should have a minimum mandatory amount of time available to explore novel food items, toys, or conspecifics, would be of benefit, in my opinion.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary, and removes the opportunity for an animal to experience novel scenarios interacting with conspecifics. I am, however, in support of the proposal for at least one attendant being available to monitor each session, much the same way a lifeguard monitors a public pool.    I would like to thank APHIS for its diligent commitment to animal welfare, and for providing the opportunity for the public to share its opinion on the proposed regulations.

Given the tremendous safety record related to supporting interactive programs at our facility and other marine parks throughout the country, I personally do not see a need for APHIS to impress animal welfare regulations related to interactive programs. o\tI currently care for the southern sea otters at Georgia Aquarium.  We currently provide a home for five sea otters, 2 males and 3 females.  Our sea otters co-exist very well together and are managed through various social groups throughout the day.  We have three separate areas that not only allow variability and changes in social settings but also gives us the ability to observe how the animals interact when given all three spaces.  When they have the choice the sea otters generally choose to all be in either the same area or with at least one other otter.  I believe APHIS mandating separations would negatively impact the social behavior we observe with the sea otters in our care.  o\tI currently care for the southern sea otters at Georgia Aquarium.  We currently have a geriatric female that is 19 years old.  As her mobility has become a challenge and her ability to get out of the pool has become more difficult, we have explored various ways in which to assist her.  Installing a ramp proved ineffective to addressing her challenge as she refuse to use it.  Our team found that making adjustments in water level of her habitat was the most successful means of assisting her in and out of the water.  I feel APHIS's mandate that ramps be made permanent fixtures in all sea otter and pinniped enclosures is unnecessary and would not have supported the goal in this case.  As animal care professionals, we are charged with making whatever accommodations are necessary to help address any issue that arises in the care of these animals.  I feel that APHIS should accept water level adjustments be considered as an option in lieu of a physical ramp for young or geriatric animals to get out of the water when deemed necessary. o\tI have 8 years of experience working with California sea lions.  Working with this species has shown me the importance of sea lions having the ability to exhibit species appropriate social behavior.  I am confused by APHIS's suggestion to move this species to a Group II pinniped, even though the species has been successfully and safely managed in a zoological setting for many years.  Moving California sea lions to Group II would take away the opportunity for them to conduct appropriate social behaviors.  I recently had the ability to assist with rescue and rehabilitation of California sea lion pups through Georgia Aquarium.  There are an unbelievable amount of stranded, non-releasable sea lions and there only chance of survival is in human care.

While dolphins at our facility are exposed to natural elements, including the sun, we have been trained to work with the animals in a manner in which we pay careful attention to the angle of the sun light so the dolphins are not looking directly into the sun. I have not seen the animals get sun burn or irritation from sun exposure.  We have a beautiful facility subject to harsh ocean winds so building a shade structure could be very difficult, expensive and unnecessary.

Our membership includes beef cattle producers, those who provide supplies and services to these farmers, as well as people who process, transport, prepare and sell beef to the American public. Last year, the Iowa beef industry generated over $5.5billion and 40,000 jobs for Iowas economy.  The current USDA APHIS proposal to allow beef imports to the U.S. from fourteen of Brazils twenty-six states is concerning because of the large economic risk to Iowa and U.S. cattle producers, as well as the health risk to the nations cattle herd.  Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is considered a highly contagious viral disease, and the inability to control an outbreak is notable, as evidenced by its presence  in over 100 countries worldwide. Under current conditions, ICA does not support the proposed rule to import fresh beef.   Iowa cattlemen and women work diligently and pride themselves on their ability to produce plentiful, safe and nutritious beef for consumers. The U.S. has preserved FMD free status for nearly 100 years. The last documented outbreak of FMD in the United States occurred in 1929.  The reputation of U.S. beef cattle in the world and the resulting beef product is a result of our rigorous national bio-security programs, effective government regulations, and focus on animal health.   The Iowa Cattlemens Associations concerns arise after an analysis of the proposed rule. When looking to the bordering countries of Brazil, only one of the ten has been verified FMD free by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).   Our apprehension about the proposed import allowance from Brazil is reflected in a third party, objective, scientific review conducted  by a team of researchers from the University of Minnesota (UMN) College of Veterinary Medicine, Center for Animal Health and Food Safety, and the Center for Veterinary Population Medicine. Their study, APHIS Risk Analysis for the FMD Risk from Importation of Fresh, Maturated, Deboned Beef from a Region in Brazil into the United States, presents three convincing arguments that should drive USDA APHIS to reconsider the importation proposal: 1) a lack of consistency and verification within the USDA APHIS risk analyses documentation; 2) no transparency in research techniques used in the risk assessments; and 3) Brazils deficiencies in complying with U.S. importation regulations.   For these reasons, the ICA has significant concerns regarding the infrastructure, committed resources, and willingness of Brazil to consistently perform adequate risk management practices in order to protect the Iowa and U.S beef cattle herd from the risk of introducing FMD into the U.S. through the importation of Brazilian beef.   Although the USDA APHIS regulatory analysis highlights potential consumer benefits from the importation of beef from Brazil, it fails to address the economic impact on consumers if the FMD virus is introduced to the U.S. cattle herd.  Due to the lack of this vital information, ICA respectfully requests that USDA APHIS consider withdrawing their proposed rule to import fresh, maturated, deboned beef from Brazil into the United States.   We appreciate the opportunity to review and comment on this significant rule regarding beef products. We have great interest in working with USDA APHIS on the issues raised in our comments and to monitor implementation of any final rule.  Sincerely,   Ed Greiman President, Iowa Cattlemens Association', 'no brazil   beef   in USA .', 'Do not let Brazil beef in support our US beef industires', 'AFTOSA2   There are 3 issues that would negated the plans to import fresh beef from Brazil as proposed  In the 1970/80s there was research done by the USDA and Dept of Defense in Uruguay and published by Norman D. Heidelbaugh, VMD a former Associate Dean of Texas AM Veterinary School. If the lymph nodes were removed and the beef was treated with ionizing radiation, there was no aftosa virus detected in the fresh beef product. However if the Brazil product was treated the same method there are 3 additional factors that would impact the beef industry in USA as follows:  1. Canada has not approved the treatment of beef with ionizing radiation. The beef imported into USA from Brazil could not be co mingled with beef that might be exported to Canada  2. Canada is much more cautious about importing meat product from aftosa countries. Thus Canada would not allow beef from the USA to be exported into Canada even if it was not treated with ionizing radiation.  3. There have been incidences where frozen bulk meat in 25 KG blocks package were exported into USA from Australia. The regulations do not permit such meat to be exported into USA if the lymph nodes had not been removed. However I noted on occasions that this product still had the lymph nodes in the frozen package at the retail level where the product was to be ground and repackaged. Australia is a developed country, Brazil is not. It is doubtful that the product from Brazil could expect to have the lymph nodes removed even when it is required and inspected. Brazil has an international reputation where they do not abide and delivering meat and poultry product acceding to the sanitary regulations. Thus it is doubtful that the USA could expect to receive the fresh meat product where the lymph nodes were removed in all cases. The lymph nodes are where the aftosa virus is in high concentrations. Thus the chance of introducing aftosa virus into would be higher than expected.     Joseph Butterweck, DVM, DACVPM Fresno, CA', 'Dear USDA,  Do not allow the importation of beef from Brazil.  Brazil has recently had outbreaks of FMD, and we have kept this disease out of this country since 1929.  It makes no sense to import beef from Brazil and risk contamination to the U.S. beef supply.  By importing beef from Brazil that could have FMD, at a lower cost you are jeopardizing both the livelihoods of the beef producers in the U.S. and also affecting their bottom line.  This is an irresponsible proposal, I ask the USDA to to deny this proposed rule and look to the U.S. producers to meet their needs with quality uncontaminated beef.

I STRONGLY object to allowing any beef products entering the United States from countries with animal health and food safety standards that are not at least as stringent as those of the United States.   I urge the USDA to re-evaluate this deplorable proposal.

This is a very real risk as the disease is present in parts of Brazil.  Prices for beef in the approved provinces would no doubt be higher so there would be incentive to move livestock from the infected areas and even other countries, such as Uraguay.  If contaminated beef is interduced to the U.S. it would then be very easy to get transferred to the feral pig and wild deer populations from garbage dumps and even picnic grounds.  After that it would be impossible to contain and lead to disaster for livestock producers.

It would be very detrimental to the live cattle market the day that you announce that you would allow such imports. You have a very strong meat packer with close ties to Brazil that can and would manipulate the market. It would end all competitiveness and destroy the free enterprise system we have here in the US. All this would be done without the consideration of food safety. To even consider this decision brings to question the integrity of our own government agencies.

How you can determine if there is no infection or possible infections if the transmission of FMD is by patterns weather or through fecal matter of birds among others? How they control the laboratories and test of diagnosis? The laboratories from Brazil are state or private? I suggest that Brazil should have a traceability system that shows from the birth of the cattle to the slaughter. There are any test to ensure presence of e-coli and mad cow disease? There is a degree of monitoring there by USA to ensure that it wouldnt have irregularities? How can Brazil ensure the movements of the cattle in the country?

Also, it is the responsibility of the USDA to insure that market prices remain profitable for the producer and affordable for the consumer aside from the fact that food safety be the #1 priority.  I have worked in the meat industry for 35 years and have always prided myself in providing our country with a safe meat product  that they could offer their family at the dinner table each night.  Why would you want to jeopardize that?  Do the members of the U.S. International Trade Commission want to feed unsafe Brazilian beef to their families even at half the price of U. S. beef?  I think not and neither do I.', 'As a consumer of beef products I am adamently opposed to the importation of Brazilian beef until there is absolutely NO chance of FMD contamination. The FDA & AFIS  have dropped the ball too many times in the past, and it will happen again. This is just plain wrong to subject the citizens of the United States to the very real probability of another food-borne illness or outbreak.', 'The Foot and Mouth Disease virus is endemic in Brazil.  Fresh and frozen Brazilian beef can spread the disease to the United States.  The virus is highly infectious and spreads quickly.  It infects animals with cloven hoofs.  Exposed livestock is usually shot, rolled into pits, and burned.  The U.S. is home to numerous susceptible wildlife species.  Exposed wildlife could not be contained and destroyed.  The U.S. would then become an endemic area.  Livestock can be vaccinated (partial success) but wildlife cannot. The initial infection is usually survived and the animal suffers a long and often incomplete recovery.  The last European outbreak was caused by imported pork that was thrown out of a restaurant.  The U.S. has uncontrolled feral hogs in 38 states that are rapidly spreading to other states.  For obvious reasons, meat imported from Foot and Mouth Disease infected countries is not welcome in countries that have healthy livestock and wildlife.', ""To whom it may concern,  I as a member of The Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association strongly oppose the USDA's proposed rule for the importation of fresh, matured, deboned beef from regions in Brazil and Argentina. TSCRA supports free trade of live cattle, beef, and/or beef products with foreign countries that have proper animal health and food safety protocols in place; however, both Brazil and Argentina lack proper protocols and have not been successful in controling foreign animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD).  As you know, protecting the U.S. cattle industry from a catastrophic foreign animal disease, such as foot and mouth disease, is a major priority for all ranchers. FMD could cause a widespread quarantine and possible massive depopulation of the cattle herd in the United States, thus compromising national security, jeopardizing our beef supply, and costing our industry hundreds of millions of dollars. Thank you W.F. Baker"", 'The importation of beef from Brazil will not only destroy the U.S. beef market, but could destroy the entire U.S. economy.  Brazil has had a major problem with foot and mouth disease.  If the U.S. gets this highly contagious disease every thing that moves will be stopped cold.  This disease not only affects cattle but all animals including wildlife. This is especially dangerous situation for our food supply not to mention for endangered species, as all animals with in 60 mile radius will have to be destroy.  Foot and Mouth Disease has a 14 day incubation period before any sign of sickness, can travel on the wind for 60 miles, and one infected animal could travel the entire length and with of the U.S. before it can diagnose.  This could be very easy for a terrorist to use to stop the entire economy.  Brazil can already import beef as long as it is already cooked.  Plus it took them 2 years to report a case of BSE, do we really want to trade with a country that will do something like that.  Plus what other countries will import cattle into Brazil so the can then be imported in the U.S. as ""Brazilian Beef"".', ""As a fifth generation rancher, I am continually amazed by the efforts of our government to harm it's citizens.  The BSE shutdown was a crippling blow to the US cattle industry but one we have overcome through hard work and considerable expense. Why would the potential importation of a highly contageous virus like Foot and Mouth Disease even be a topic of discussion in this country.  Our part of the southwest has been desimated by four to five years of drought.  Our cattle numbers are half what they have historicaly been and we have struggled to remain a viable business.  Fortunately the reduced inventory has created increased value for producers and allowed them to meet the financial obligations created by the increased costs of production, ie., feed, fuel, fertilizer, insurance, etc.  We have tried to further enhance our profitability by marketing through value added programs that emphasize all natural beef and naturally colored mohair.  The emphasis on antibiotic and hormone free feeder calves not only effects the total pounds of beef we have to sell but creates a greater risk from disease.    People are more aware of what they put into their bodies than ever before.  They are demanding change from traditional production practices to maintain healthier lifestyles.and we are trying to provide beef that meets that demand.  A FMD outbreak would devistate that public confidence and put large numbers of producers out of business thus increasing our dependence on inferior foreign products at a inflated price to consumers.  I strongly oppose the importation of any comodities that do not meet the standards set by the USDA much less ones that have the potential to distroy not only an American industry but a way of life."", 'I am not in favor of importing beef from Brazil.

This product is currently not allowed to import into the United States because of the same reasons meat is not allowed from Brazil.  Due to the cattle shortage in the U.S. and other areas the price of raw Australian Fetal Bovine serum is now $1,000 per liter and raw U.S. origin Fetal Bovine Serum at $300 per liter and raw Fetal Bovine Serum from USDA approved countries, Mexico, Canada, Panama is now over $200 per liter.  The price of raw Brazilian Fetal Bovine Serum is $70 per liter.  Prices have more than doubled in the U.S. for all the different origins of fetal bovine serum in the last 2 years and they will continue to increase as more people switch from Australian to U.S. origin.  Fetal Bovine Serum is used to produce human/animal vaccines, medical diagnostic tests and is also used in very large quantities in cell culture at universities and hospitals throughout the U.S.  It is a fundamental product for all cell culture research done in in the U.S. in relation to cancer and basically every disease known to man.  The biggest scientific breakthroughs in research are happening using Fetal Bovine Serum.  In Europe, Brazilian FBS has been used in cell culture for the past 20 years.  It is used as the primary product in cell culture research throughout Europe by 80% of the potential users.  Our European colleagues have been using Brazilian FBS with success for many years and are getting a high quality product at more than half the cost of what researchers in the United States have to pay.  With the current increase in prices and lack of supply the researcher at Harvard and Stanford is now and in the future going to be paying 5X to 10X more for US origin and USDA fetal bovine serum compared to what their colleague and or competitor in  Europe will be paying.   If the current market conditions do not change than eventually less cell culture research will be done in the U.S. because Fetal Bovine Serum will take up more of the limited budgets.  There just is not enough FBS in the U.S. to meet our demands and the U.S. needs to allow the importation of Brazilian FBS before the costs of vaccines get too high and the output of medical research gets affected.', ""It is interesting and extremely frightening that you are considering allowing Brazilian beef into the U.S. considering their poor track record with Foot and Mount disease.  It only takes one case to destroy the stellar record that cattle producers here in the U.S. have established.  At one time the state of Montana was classified as a Brucellosis free state.  The cattle producers in Montana had spent millions of dollars ensuring that brucellosis was not present in any herd within the state.  There were strict regulations for cattle coming in from other states to ensure that the disease didn't come into the state from elsewhere.  Then in one flourish of a pen, that was destroyed when the governor of Montana extended the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park.  All that hard work and money was down the drain.

I have seen with my own eyes how the system is manipulated.  In the case of Brazil.  When Russia banned meat products from the State of Goias.  The live cattle were then diverted to neighboring Brazilian states, that were not banned from Russia.  The trucks went straight from the farms in Goias to the slaughterhouses in Sao Paulo without any tire wash or any kind of treatment as should be the case. The economic impact on Beef prices would be negligble to the US Economy as we currently have import protocol in place with Non FMD countries.  My concern is the lack of controls in Countries such as Brazil.    We in the United States tend to be naive in thinking that other countries will follow the rules.

I find it extremely irresponsible and disturbing on your part that you would even consider allowing an import of beef that could potentially invite in Foot & Mouth Disease and who knows what other pathogens. Any outbreak or introduction of disease into our system would ultimately kill our own farmers lively-hood and potentially infect our own animals - you are seriously opening up a can of worms. Sure you can argue it will be regulated - but we all know - and I speak from personal experience as an Ex-Federal Government employee that all things start out closely monitored/regulated but once the dust and limelight settles - it becomes all too easy to look the other way. It's not always about the money - stop operating out of your pocket -get out of bed with the corrupt people and start doing what is right for once. The demise of this country began when we started going outside of ourselves - allowing outsourcing etc - be honest with yourself -each and everyone of us experiences it in some way almost every day.   I find it interesting that today in the news that 8.7 million pounds of beef is being recalled because it was deemed unfit for human consumption and dangerous - that was meat processed a YEAR ago - here is a classic example on how the USDA did not properly do their job! And you think it's going to be any different when it comes to monitoring imports- how foolish can you be? If they cannot be responsible for what is currently inside our borders there is absolutely no way in hell they will be any more proficient in monitoring what is coming from other countries. Classic example - remember the tainted pet food that killed tons of our animals from China.   On a side note: If the current beef shortage in this country is your motivation for entertaining this foolishness - then step in and help our own farmers recover - do not go out and invite in a myriad of problems. There are solutions that exist to save ourselves - pipe in water, bring down feed costs, etc. If we can run huge oil pipelines for the greed of the few then certainly to God we can pipe in water to parched fields for the betterment of all. Work on solutions here!!!  Bringing in beef from Brazil is currently way too risky a proposition especially coming from a country who is dealing with ongoing disease.

Table 1 is an absolute joke where ""95.8 percent of the cases upon which the table was based were described as only possibly involving the magnets of interest"" Even when counting that many ""maybes"" in the data there are still only 35 cases of emergency department assistance being required.  Contrast this against the 2.7m sets sold and the accidents for which this rule is intended to prevent is reduced to being completely trivial.  The Commission has failed to show that an unreasonable risk of injury exists given the low incidence of emergency care given and that swallowing incidents can be blamed on negligent of parents not an inherently unsafe product.', 'You are horrible for making these decisions and hounding the companies that make these magnetic products! Someone\'s business is now lost because of this. You\'ve harassed Buckyballs into deciding to stop manufacturing their product. You\'ve succeeded in what you wanted, to get the product off all shelves. But in the process of doing so, you have eliminated many jobs, something hard to come by in this economy, and someones business that they worked hard to build.  Not only that, you stayed blind to the fact that these products were intended for adults, not children! The people making the complaints had to have noticed the warning labels. There are several all over the packaging and inserts. You even have to sign something saying it is for adults when you buy online. The people making the complaints are more than likely the ""sue happy"" type. Unfortunately you have let them win and let the working class lose.', ""I am one physician in a 5 member group of practicing Pediatric Gastroenterologist in Portland, OR.  We have been seeing several children who have ingested these dangerous high powered magnets in the last 6 months, producing urgent or emergent medical situations requiring extensive investigation (medical procedures) and in some cases, abominal surgery to prevent or repair the significant damage to these childrens' intestines caused by these magnets.  There is no need for these products to be sold on the market for entertainment.  I would support legislation that would ban or severely restrict the sale of these items in the USA."", 'People need to be responsible..period', 'This isn\'t so much a discussion about the dangers of magnets, but more the CPSC and Pediatric Gastroenterologist organizations trying to flex their power.  They\'ve organized their members to submit comments that continually repeat that ""people cannot be trusted to listen to warnings"", while never addressing the arguments against theirs. If the CPSC won\'t listen to the 85%+ public consensus against the ban, perhaps the CPSC should listen to Nancy Voice-of-Reason Nord, the CPSC\'s own most experienced commissioner, when she says:    The assumption that warnings don\'t work, undermine past safety standards deemed acceptable by the CPSC and US Congress.   The ban is overly broad. The ban includes products [like Zen Magnets] that have not demonstrated risks similar to other behaviors.   These magnets have much more utility, and lower instance of hazard than other products on the market.  Statistics should be provided by the CPSC to broadly demonstrate the comparable danger of zenmagnets to other banned products in order to show that a magnetic ball ban would  NOT be an anomaly among banned products instead of making arguments that try to redefine or, worse yet, negate reasonable safety standards.', ""I believe that these magnet sets should not be banned so long as they are not marketed to children.  We do not ban the sale of knives because children could be seriously injured if they play with them, we just don't market them as children's toys.  BuckyBalls have had warnings on them for years that they are not to be ingested or played with by small children.  That should be enough."", 'Banning a product based off a rare situation is not productive. Sure, magnetic marbles pose a potential safety concern, but the concern is just that, potential. Like other products that warn parents of choking hazard due to small parts, at most, magnet sets should have to warn parents of the potential dangers.  I\'ll probably lose credibility but I must still bring up that the logic in banning magnet sets because of ingestion, even after warning, would have anything anyone has gotten stuck in their butt banned. A simple web search for ""Rectal Foreign Bodies"" will return many results to a paper that details the numerous objects that have gotten willfully lodged in a person\'s body. The point of bringing up inserting objects into the rectum is that it\'s unlikely anyone has seriously considered banning products due to curious idiots doing unwise things; children eating things is the same situation, only because ""child"" is the subject and not ""drunk frat boy"" are magnet sets being considered for a ban.  The ban has good intentions, but does not solve the underlying issue of lack of education. An individual has the right to know the possible dangers of a product, and the right to decide if they will purchase or use said product. An individual does not have the right to enforce their own decisions on others as it would infringe on the other\'s right to decide.', ""These magnets are a useful and fun way to learn about magnets and their properties. Banning the item altogether shouldn't be done. Perhaps posting warnings or making the magnets available to purchase only for adults would be a better solution than banning them altogether."", ""Rare earth magnets have been sold in hobby shops for years without issue or need for regulation to prevent ingestion. I believe the outright banning of the magnets is a heavy-handed and obnoxious way to address a statistically small number of incidents.  Alternative #4 suggests the use of childproof packaging and suggests this might be difficult to develop. I see no reason why responsible adults could not keep their magnet sets in the same child-proof canisters used to prevent children accessing medicine. Perhaps a different color plastic could be used to clearly distinguish the container from medicinal canisters.  Furthermore, I find much of the reasoning in the proposed rule speculative and unsubstantiated. There are many small items that would be hazardous for children to swallow that adults purchase and display on a regular basis. I would suggest that small items that are sharp or fragile may present the same or greater health risks when swallowed. I see no reason to single out magnet sets as a risk dangerous enough to require a ban.  This issue does not need to be addressed with a ban on a perfectly innocent product. It should be addressed by proper adult supervision of children and storage of their magnet sets. Anyone who raises children is aware swallowing small items is a hazard. Frankly, I believe the introduction of this rule is a waste of CPSC resources and consequently the citizenry's money."", 'Banning magnet sets is pointless over-stepping.

With the limited number of injuries reported with these toys compared to the thousands upon thousands of injuries sustained by trampolines alone, the proposed safety standard and legal action are ridiculous.

Make a waiver be required for purchase, add extra labeling, but do not perform the idiotic maneuver of banning these extremely capable tools for learning and engaged, productive distraction, simply because there are parents who use no forethought or have no capability to oversee their own children.', 'What a waste of government time and resources. Making them illegal because they are irresponsibly used but not inherently dangerous is akin to making cars illegal because sometimes people crash.', 'I cannot see any reason to regulate the sale of magnets to adults, that are meant for adults.', 'This is perhaps the most ridiculous overstretch of government authority I believe I have ever witnessed.  Around 30% of all choking deaths in infants and children were attributed to balloons.  So it stands to reason that balloons which are marketed as toys are more of a threat than magnetic desk toys which are not marketed as toys.  This appears to be a war on a single industry that flies in the face of logic, reason, and the very statistics that it claims as a defense.  If you are going to ban  magnets, then do balloons next.. perhaps pennies as well..

The basis to mask data with using ALL types of magnet related incidents to justify taking down legitimate companies is a stretch.    Again convincing the public that warning labels are useless just shows how well thought out the argument of a proposed ban is.  If this rule passes then it takes responsibilities out of parents who ignores warning labels and diminishes the rights of small businesses such as Bucky balls.

This is an increasing occurrence, some may even say an EPIDEMIC, and is best prevented not by scolding parents, but by getting these objects off store shelves.

I wholeheartedly support this ban!', 'I must express my opposition to the creation of new safety standards what would ban the sale of ""collections of loose high powered magnets.""   All of the evidence I have found point to this being an instance of the CPSC trying to solve a problem that America doesn\'t have. Companies making products such as ZenMagnets and Buckyballs have been vigilant in labeling their products as not being toys and include warnings notifying buyers not to give them to children.   There exist real, more pressing issues that pose actual threats to children, such as malnutrition and homelessness, both of which affect several orders of magnitude more children than the magnetic gadgets the CPSC is trying to ban the sale of.

For starters, these magnet sets are products intended for and marketed to adults, this is made very clear on the web site. Because of this, the concern over children injuring themselves with these by doing stupid things like eating them is an entirely moot point. Children could also injure or kill themselves by ingesting bleach, their parents medications, and THOUSANDS of other more commonly available things but I dont see any effort to do away with those things. Why is that? Children are not supposed to have these so its not really the companys fault if they somehow acquire them and injure themselves or even die because of them. This possibility also should not ruin the product for the intended market. Not only that but in this time of a bad economy, is it really wise and in anyones best interest to go and take actions that shut down the small entrepreneurs legitimate business?

Why challenge this decision for magnet sets, of all things?  There are countless products on the market that pose a danger when swallowed by children. Attempting to ban any of them is an effort in futility. Defining the line where something is appropriate to ban is too nebulous, and takes decision-making power from the consumer, especially if applied to a product that is harmless when used as directed. We aren't talking about radioactive waste for sale on the market, we're talking about magnets. The implication behind the ban is that the public is unable to properly use this product, and must be protected from themselves--a very poor message, and a poor basis for any decision.

You may as well ban pencils because they are pointy or cleaning products because they are poisonous.

This is a toy for teenagers or adults which should have the common sense to not swallow them.  This toy is no more dangerous than any other small toy that a child could potentially ingest. Yes it can cause a pinch if it is swallowed but other toys can be equally dangerous. The bottom line is that this toy is not meant to be used by children and parents have to be responsible enough to know this.

Magnets (such as those sold by Zen Magnets) have much more utility, and lower instance of hazard, than many other products on the market that are commonly found in homes.

Are we to ban kitchen knives; or weed killer; or steam irons; or nail scissors; or forks?  A child in Australia fell on a pencil and died when it went into into their mouth and penetrated their brain -- should we ban pencils because of a rare event like this, or should we say that parents should be more responsible?  The reasonable thing is to provide clear warnings and to have parents take responsiblity to ensure that adult things and children are kept apart.  The unreasonnable thing would be for governments to ban kitchen knives or weed killer or pencils -- or magnets.  Banning magnets would be a good example of a government intruding too far.  2.

The  leading causes of death in captive elephants are foot disorders and arthritis, which  are caused by prolonged chaining, intense confinement, and forced inactivity.  Since 2000, more than half of the 49 elephants who have died at zoos accredited  by the Aquarium & Zoo Association never reached their 40th birthdays, dying far  short of their 70-year life expectancies.  Because of their intelligence, complexity, sensitivities, and unique social and  physical needs, elephants suffer immensely in small, unchallenging captive  environments. To make matters worse for elephants, in circuses, every instinctual  behavior is subject to discipline. If elephants reach for grass, try to comfort friends,  or extend their trunks to smell something new or different, they get hit with  bullhooks. If they blow a trick during a performance, they get beaten afterward.  Despite the fact that elephants fare miserably in captivity, zoos and circuses are  supportvociferously defending the status quo.

At 53 years old, Clara is not (as the St. Louis Zoo claims) elderly for an Asian  elephant, a species that has a natural lifespan of 70 years, and her severely  debilitated condition is not a natural result of the aging process. Her painful  arthritis, chronic foot abscesses and sole erosions are a direct result of the  cramped and unnatural zoo environment. It is disingenuous, dishonest and hurtful  to elephants for the St. Louis Zoo to insist that Clara's health condition is a result  of her age.   Even five years ago, Clara could have healed from her captivity-induced ailments  had she been transferred to a sanctuary with the space and natural habitat  necessary for her feet to mend. Instead, the St. Louis Zoo chose to keep her in  the very environment that caused these problems the first place. It is almost  certainly too late to save her now.   A new baby, Ellie, has just been born at the St. Louis Zoo and faces the same  fate unless drastic changes are made. If the St. Louis Zoo cannot provide the  space and conditions elephants need to thrive, then it must send these elephants  someplace that can.

However,  over the years, as we have gained more knowledge of animals  and their native habitats and their requirements for good health, it is irresponsible  not to change these conditions for the better.  Monetary gain is not justification to  confine animals for public viewing, or to transport them in circuses for public  enjoyment.  And, it does come down to business and profit at the expense of the  animals\' health.  It is no different than people who run puppy mills, or who sell  baby ducks right before Easter.  Animals are not in the world for our monetary  gain and enjoyment.  And if we do not represent their best interests, who will?     We live in the country and people drop animals, mostly dogs and cats, in front of  our house when they are tired of caring for them.  Last year a young Dalmatian  was dropped off.  What a beautiful dog, about a year old.  It was almost a year to  the day after the release of the second Dalmaitian movie. The dog was sold as a  puppy right after that movie release.

Please consider this letter and think of the loss of education when animal/mammal interactions can not take place.  It is not the same as a book.', 'I am a volunteer at Miller Park Zoo in Bloomington,  Illinois and work with members of the International Marine Animal Trainers\' Association.    IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species  to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'I am a Senior Animal Trainer at the San Diego Zoo and have been a professional animal trainer for 10 years. I hold memberships in the following professional organizations: Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Animal Behavior Managment Alliance.  Interactive programs are designed with human and animal safety in mind. There is no scientific evidence that more regulation is needed. Zoos and aquariums that are members of the AZA and/or IMATA have exemplary safety records and additional regulation will not benefit the animals.  Placing limits on the amount of interaction that an animal receives per day ignores the inherent differences between animals, which are best judged by their keepers and trainers who work with them every day and know each individual best. Interaction is accepted to be enriching to animals\' lives throughout the animal training community. It is offered to each animal through its own choice, one of the pillars of animal welfare. No animal is forced to interact when it does not want to. However, many animals choose to participate in interactions, and making laws to prevent them from doing so would be deleterious to their welfare. Our training and enrichment programs are exemplary, leave the judgement of administering them to people who know what they\'re doing.  If you regulate that there must be one trainer to each animal, most of the animals will be denied the opportunity to participate in their training/interactive session, because it is too difficult to obtain enough qualified staff for that. Animal trainers with appropriate experience can easily work with more than one appropriately trained animal at a time. Again, this should be left to the judgement of those administering their programs. They know what they can and can\'t do, and I wish to emphasize that human and animal safety is a top priority for everyone involved.

Thank you, APHIS, for your concern. I am sure you will hear from a lot of people who think that we are treating animals wrong. This could not be further from the truth.

There are obviously many who think that all creatures should be in their natural, wild environments and would like to see every zoo, aquarium and circus put out of business.  I disagree with them.  I believe that through education and interaction we are given the unique opportunity to learn about the creatures with whom we share the planet and thus develop knowledge in how human actions often interfere with the balance of nature.  My nieces, who are now 3 and 5 years-old, are keenly aware of how pollution and litter affect animals.   I realized this when I took them to a Florida beach and they were very concerned about making sure the beach was clean for ""their dolphins"" and also their concern about the litter they see along the roadways.  Just this week they were greeted by a 9 foot black snake in their playhouse.  There was no fear.  They were intrigued by the encounter and participated in the snake\'s relocation.  Their interest in nature has been stimulated by adventures to places like SeaWorld, Gatorland, zoos in Pittsburgh and Tampa, and Living Treasures in Moraine.  It is important that we preserve these positive experiences.    Having said that, I also realize that regulations are imperative in order to assure that all businesses operate in the best interest of creatures who have no voice.  I appreciate your work in continuing to develop good regulatory policy and trust that APHIS will always consider scientific evidence over emotional rhetoric.', ""In the late 1960's when I watched Sea World being in built in San Diego I was excited at what it proposed for the future.  Not only would there be wholesome family entertainment but education of how better to care for the sea and its inhabitants was one step closer to reality.  Sea World has never disappointed in either.  I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.      There is no question that marine parks like SeaWorld are critical to not only the well-being of animals in human care but to continued rescue and rehabilitation of those in the wild.

I look forward to have the opportunity to visit SeaWorld and other marine mammal parks for years to come.  Sincerely yours, Very Rev. Msgr. Dennis L. Mikulanis Life-long San Diegan"", 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Dolphins and whales have been shown by recent scientific research to be sensitive with likely more ranges of emotions than humans, with culture that is handed down through generations, and personal names.  They deserve our respect and the right to remain in the wild, free from harassment and harm.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'Zoos and aquariums provide a service of education to people of this great nation that a person can not get any where else.

Without these facilities people will loose the chance to see the beauty and intelligence of these animals, which might increase the desire to seek them out in the wild which is invasive and dangerous for both humans and animals if not participated in a professional way. By listening to public opinion as well as skewed media and not actual scientific facts, we will loose the only real, true direct link we have to marine life.   These facilities care deeply for their animals and their passion is enriching to the animal's life as well as educating the public about the animals intelligence and habitat and how we can help take care of them in the wild. I saw this first hand at many facilities all around the country. The Georgia Aquarium and Sea World in Orlando are both facilities that I am greatly impressed with the information that is presented as well as the cleanliness and professionalism of their facilities. Closer to home, Dolphin Quest has always been a great resource for tourist and local people combined. Being open to the public to observe the dolphins as well as ask any questions from one of the employees is something that is rare among marine life facilities. I have always enjoyed every encounter I have had at Dolphin Quest and the staff's level of expertise and devotion to their animals really shines through. It's obvious that their animals are well taken care of and find their training reinforcing.

I would like to thank APHIS first of all, for making sure that all the Mamal parks in the USA provide more than outstanding care and treatment of their animals.  I absolutely love going to the DRC and have no reservations about the welfare or treatment of their dolphins, sea lions or other creatures whatsoever.  The kindness of the staff, right down to the ladies that work in the Gift Shop, is more than just ""doing their job"" its a vocation for all of them.  I love swimming in the water with the dolphins, i do not think the water is murky or dirty, it is about as natural as can be.  I am not a very good swimmer, and i tell this to the trainer right from the start, i have the confidence to swim out and let the dolphin swim beside me and let me take hold of it\'s dorsal fin, sometimes two dolphins swim with me, sometimes they don\'t want to, which is ok, as they have their own little ""dolphinalities"" and will do exactly what they want to, which is fine by me! I understand that the welfare of these beautiful animals must be the priority here, but i really believe that the DRC has done and is doing the very best for them.  I am an ordinary working class person here in the UK, and it takes me some time to save up money and come over to the Florida Keys and swim with the dolphins.  I really love this Center and believe that it is a brilliant place for people to come and train to be Marine Biologists, or whatever the correct terminoligy is.  I have always been swimming with one trainer and two dolphins, but there may be other staff with them, they always seem to be extremely competent, and the dolphins seem to absolutely love what they are doing.

In 2005, we had an outbreak of anthrax that reduced our herd by 1/3. Many of our neighbors both within a 30 mile radius and as far away as 80 miles were effected by this infection. The disease traveled quickly and even though we immediately vaccinated our herd when we were informed that the infection was in the area, we buried animals for 6 weeks. Our state veterinarian's  office was on top of the epidemic and quarantined herds immediately. It still did not stop the spread of the disease.   The importation of animals from areas known to have hoof and mouth disease is extremely scary to me. We need to have secure food sources for our citizens and to do this we need to preserve the health of the United States herd.

We have the safest food supply in the world and we should keep it that way. All imported food should have the source and processing countries clearly labeled', 'I very strongly oppose the APHIS proposal to allow the importation of beef from 14 states of Brazil due to the presence of Foot-and Mouth Disease (FMD) throughout the country and neighboring regions of South America. I believe that beef imports should not be allowed from Brazil or any other country infected with FMD, period.  An outbreak of FMD is perhaps the most serious threat facing animal agriculture production in the United States. I say this as someone who has spent most of his lifetime in the beef and dairy industries. Given the seriousness of the FMD threat posed by Brazilian beef imports, an informed observer might reasonably expect such a dangerous scheme to have been hatched by a terrorist group like al Qaeda, rather than APHIS, the lead U.S. Government agency charged with protecting the health of Americas livestock.  The APHIS risk analysis report reveals that of the proposed Brazilian beef imports would pose significant risks to the United States, including: \tIntroduction of the FMD virus to the U.S. through infected meat; \tMassive economic costs of an FMD outbreak to U.S. livestock producers and consumers; and  \tQuarantines resulting in the loss of U.S. meat exports.  The APHIS proposal relies on regionalization, the failed concept underlying this failed proposal. Bill Bullard, CEO of R-CALF USA, a grassroots livestock producer group, correctly noted the problems with past regionalization attempts in a recent article published by The Milkweed, a dairy industry publication. See Bullards comment at http://www.themilkweed.com/The%20Milkweed%20Bullard%20Interview%20Mar%202014.pdf  The APHIS risk analysis report estimates potential economic costs in the range of $37 billion to $42 billion if an FMD outbreak were to occur in the U.S. Yet this estimate, costly as it is, may be too conservative. Maureen McCarthy, a Department of Homeland Security weapons adviser, in 2006 estimated an FMD outbreak would cost the U.S. agricultural economy hundreds of billions of dollars and close U.S. meat export markets for years. (See http://www.hlswatch.com/index.php?s=foot-and-mouth) Livestock prices have since increased in the following eight years, making Ms. McCarthys real cost estimate even higher.  Under either cost estimate scenario, rural communities in major livestock states would be devastated by the direct economic costs of an FMD outbreak and the resulting loss of meat export markets. Many rural areas have already lost population over recent decades due to lack of economic opportunities. An FMD outbreak in the U.S. would escalate this trend.  Were an FMD outbreak to occur in the U.S., federal and state government treasuries would be further stressed by the massive costs of cleanup and compensation, and the loss of tax revenues from livestock production. Massive tax increases would be necessary to offset the mounting costs of an FMD outbreak in the U.S., a thought that should discourage any conservative ideologues who might support Brazilian beef imports in the name of free trade.  American food security would be undermined at a time when U.S. cattle inventories are at a 60-year low and beef prices have reached record-high levels. Domestic production of beef, pork, sheep and other meat, along with dairy products, could be sharply curtailed. The resulting loss of animal protein production  and rising retail food prices  would cause further hardship for millions of American consumers whose food budgets are under pressure in todays sluggish economic recovery.  It appears that APHISs only concern is too facilitate global free trade by removing this vital sanitary barrier to trade, regardless of the potential costs of American livestock producers and consumers. I served as a member of the USDA/USTR Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee for Trade during the WTO Seattle Round negotiations, and have had extensive contacts with my foreign agricultural counterparts and government officials representing our major trading partners. I am aware of the issues, interests, and risks involved, and believe most U.S. citizens would strongly oppose the APHIS proposal if they were aware of its risks.  Considering the risks, the only rational response is not just to flatly reject the APHIS proposal. Congress should hold public hearings to determine who is responsible, and exactly how this dangerous proposal even saw the light of day. The responsible officials should immediately be shown the door, and the agency (and perhaps the entire department) should be massively reformed and reconfigured to carry out its basic mission: To protect the health and value of American agriculture and natural resources.', ""This is ridiculous to even propose such an outlandish thing!

Do NOT import beef from Brazil, unless you want food to be contaminated and a whole Agriculture sector put out of business.

First, and most important is the risk of introducing Foot and Mouth Disease.

Even if the risk is minimal, what would we gain that would be worth putting this nation's livestock industry in jeopardy?  Secondly, the cattle producers in the USA are more than capable of supplying the safest, best quality beef for the needs of this country.  Does Brazil have a safety inspection system in place that compares to ours?  Are their pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, feed additives , etc. regulated at the same level as ours?  Are their slaughter facilities clean, humane, and able to pass EPA regulations?  Is their cost of production even close to ours?  Can their government be trusted to do what they say?  If the answer to these questions is no, then we would be importing an inferior product, possibly with disease or residues, through an inferior inspection process, with few if any trace-back regulations.  This product would enter the best, safest market in the world at a reduced cost and my product would have to compete with it.  Is my own government trying to put me out of business?"", 'To who, it may Concern:      I find this very troubling and hope and pray that this is put to a complete stop.

Where U.S. import ports are also consumer regions, far from U.S. beef production, the arrival of imports might also be cheaper and more efficient in accessing these U.S. markets.  Your econometricians could do some Input-Output modelling on the economic impacts of added reefer container imports through the transport chain derived from activities starting with discharge and unloading at U.S. ports.  That alone, could be modeled and would show quite an impact on direct, indirect, and induced jobs and backflow in taxes to the government.  In the foreign policy arena, noting the WTO Cotton ruling against U.S. subsidies and the fact that Brazil, has, to this day withheld retaliation, opening access to Brazilian exports of beef could be considered a very adroit good-faith gesture and stave off Brazilian protectionism of higher value-added U.S. goods seeking access to the Brazil market.  On the eve of a potential trade war, the opening of U.S. market would be a very good signal for international cooperation.  It is also worth noting that opening the U.S. market to Brazilian beef may unlock even more foreign direct investment among Brazilian meatpacking firms coming to the U.S.  Market leader JBS has been in the U.S. for some time, as has Marfrig, but behemoth Brasil Foods and a number of highly productive Brazilian cooperatives may now see opportunities to invest in the U.S. creating jobs in U.S. and multiplying the international export opportunities from U.S. base.  I can see the same opportunities for U.S. meat companies going to Brazil. Already Brazil plays host to multinationals Tyson, Bunge, Cargill, ADM, Marfrig (Keystone), and JBS (Swift, Pilgrims Pride).   Patriotism and myopia aside, this is a good deal for the U.S. Bleeding heart and emotional comments may lack the perspective outlined above.    Issuance of the new rule should facilitate leading edge cooperation between MAPA, EMBRAPA, ANVISA, USDA, APHIS etc.  A possibility emerges where the U.S. and Brazil and global champions can set international standards and practices to the benefit of U.S. producers and consumers.  While we do not know even yet if Brazilian beef and what types will be acceptable and competitive to the U.S. market, we know one result that could be negative to the U.S. economy.  Asian and European nations will acknowledge the rule and perhaps allow or facilitate more their markets for Brazilian beef exports. As has been shown with the Santa Catarina ruling on pork, it may be that the ruling helps Brazil's export to third countries other than the U.S., which could come at a cost to U.S. market share of foreign markets.  All told, I believe the employment, competition, FDI, lest we not forget consumer choice benefits outweigh any possible threat to U.S. production interest.  To the contrary, this opening could unlock latent trade and investment opportunities that will bring Brazil and U.S. economies and countries closer together.  In today's world, having stronger relations with countries that share federalism, continental dimensions, pluralism, democracy and ethnic diversity is not such a bad thing."", ""To the knot heads that want Brizil beef in the U.S.A.

I remember not being able to market my calves at an even breakeven price because of a mad cow discovery in recent years. I might add that this cow was traced to a Canadian herd. I believe that some countries in the world should maintain the highest standards in food production and to give this up for whatever economic reason would result in the demise of every producer and consumer in the nation. Maybe the powers that be should ask why.organic and drugfree produce is in such high demand and commands high prices.People need to have healthy food and they want it and they deserve it.  I do not believe that the cheapest and most mass produced options are always the best in all circumstances. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA', ""I strongly oppose the importation of beef from Brazil and surrounding areas.

In reality, it should have never been considered.  Cattle and beef producers across the United States are struggling to make a living.  This adds unfair and unneeded competition for American Producers.  Additionally, there appear to be no safeguards to prevent contaminated and diseased Brazilian beef from entering the marketplace.  Since there are no requirements for country of origin labeling, consumers won't know where the beef they are eating originated.  This is simply bad policy"", 'I do not believe importing meat, animals, etc into the US is beneficial for anyone in the United States. This risk could be disasterous to not only livestock and ranchers but everyone. If people can get into the United States with illegal items what makes you think it can be proven that these animals, meat, etc do not have diseases? I understand nothing is fool proof, but why even take a chance? We need to support our own producers and not other countries!', 'After reading the proposed rule: Importation of Beef: Region in Brazil, I have several concerns. The first of which is the evaluation of pH at packing plants in Brazil, The rule proposal states ""APHIS considers pH testing and calibration of pH meters to be critical mitigation measures in assessing the risk of importing the FMD virus in beef from Brazil. I could not find any secondary control measures to prevent infected beef from entering the U.S. borders. If a single pH meter is faulty or miscalibrated it then becomes possible to send infected beef into our country. Put checks in place in Brazil and also at the border crossing as the product enters our nation to double, triple and exponentially check that FMD is not entering our country.  Second the report states that APHIS concluded that as long as FMD is endemic in the overall region in South America, there is a risk of reintroduction from adjacent areas into the proposed exporting region. This is a fast moving disease that can grow at an epidemic scale. Brazil seems to be well on the way to eradicating the disease, but as U.S. producers we cannot afford to take the risk of introducing the disease into our herd. We need to wait until the country is 100%  FMD free! At the very minimum place a geographic ""buffer zone"" of disease free area around the region that we propose to accept animals from.   These risks are very real and the average producer and the local emergency management services in the United States are not prepared to deal with the disease if it is introduced in this country. Keeping our country FMD free is the only answer!  Next the report moves into economic impact. This is the most troubling section of the report for beef producers at all levels of the supply chain. The report states:   Due to the increase in supply, it is estimated that the wholesale price of beef, the retail price of beef, and the price of cattle (steers) would decline by 0.11 percent, 0.04 percent, and 0.14 percent, respectively....... The fall in beef prices and resulting decline in U.S. production would translate into reduced returns for producers in the livestock and beef processing sectors. Under the 40,000 MT import scenario, cattle producers and beef processors are estimated to incur declines in welfare of 0.68 percent and 0.14 percent, respectively....... The shift by consumers to beef due to the price decline would cause downward pressure on the prices of pork and other meats. The largest of these market declines, though still very small, would be for swine and pork. It is estimated for the 40,000 MT import scenario that the welfare of swine producers and pork processors would decline by 0.02 percent and 0.01 percent, respectively.  Beef producers today are faced with razor thin margins. We are facing the lowest cattle numbers since the 1950\'s. An epic drought in the mid-west has forced the cow herd to decline. We are seeing markets and pastures come back into alignment to offer opportunity to begin to rebuild the U.S. cow herd. It is devastating to our hard-working cattlemen to think that the Federal Government would consider actions that will hinder our forward progress after 5 years of difficult production. Also the pork industry is currently facing its own epidemic in the PEDv virus that is killing millions of pigs. They don\'t need any more international competition either.   In conclusion, my hat is off to Brazil and the leaps and bounds they\'ve made becoming a major factor in the international beef market. However, now is not the time to put our nations beef herd at risk of infection from FMD or to take dollars out of our producers pockets and put them in the pockets of Brazilian cattlemen. Let the Brazilians eradicate FMD from their entire country, let our domestic cattlemen have the opportunity to rebuild and recover from the droughts and adverse market conditions of the last few years, then re approach the importation of foreign beef.', 'I do not approve. Importing Brazilian beef is subjecting our food supply to an unnecessary risk of Hoof and Mouth Disease.', 'Do not do this. it is too risky, knowing that bringing foot-and mouth disease to the USA is a possibility.

This country does not need imported beef at all.', 'As a PhD candidate in Security Studies with a focus on biosecurity, I object strongly to the opening of US markets to live beef from countries which have not secured WHO certification as Foot and Mouth Disease free. FMD has proven to be both economically and biologically devastating to farmers and ranchers and consumers in place after place around the world in the last two centuries as world trade has accelerated and facilitated exposure to this virulent pathogen.  Brazil has been OIE certified as FMD free in just two of twenty-six states and in the face of that limited certified disease free territory relaxed the vaccination regimen almost two years ago.  This does not bode well for the country to achieve country wide or even region-wide disease free status anytime soon.    The ostensible reason for the admission of this risky animal population is that the market price of beef has to be reduced for the consumer.  The amount of beef to be imported from Brazil will not provide significant price relief for the American consumer and should there be the exposure to a single diseased animal could very well result in a substantial increase in cost to all of us.    Finally, a short investigation determines that a single multi-national agricultural mega  corporation stands to benefit almost exclusively from putting the American consumer or the American Cattleman at substantial risk.  This is bad and risky policy and should not be allowed.

They are quite a popular toy. I would recommend against outlawing them. Kids can choke/ingest lots of small things (like coins) which we don't outlaw. Perhaps a law to prevent kids under 12 from purchasing them. That would seem more reasonable than an outright ban."", ""The banning of these magnets is not necessary. While I don't want small children to be harmed, it is not that challenging to keep things away from them.

Everyday consumer items which are found in every household, pushpins, earrings, paperclips, dice, beads, they are all small enough to be ingested by a child.  Why can't we place blame where blame is due? If children are getting their hands on these magnets, somewhere there is a parent who didn't do their job. We keep beer and liquor in our fridges and cleaning supplies under the sink, and nobody is calling to ban these items although both are easily accessible to children.  Even if you are claiming beer and liquor are on a high shelf and cleaning products are in a cabinet which probably has child preventive snap hooks, you are making the same argument I am. The parents took precautions to keep those things away from their children. If improperly stored, they become accessible to children.  One final argument. There are no laws against me owing a gun and keeping it in my house. In fact, there are no laws stating I have to keep my gun locked up securely in my house. If I decided to leave my gun loaded on my night stand every night, I would be well within my right to do so, and the only time this would become an issue is if my child gets to it and an incident occurs, at which point I would be held accountable for child endangerment.   So why can't I be trusted to own magnets and keep my children away from them?   This proposed rule is a waste of government time and tax payers dollars."", ""You shouldn't blame a product for an incident of human stupidity. It's like blaming the rug for tripping someone instead of blaming them for not looking down.   All this tells me is that people need to watch their kids a little closer.

They are extremely powerful, yet small, and are easily swallowed.  They can be extremely destructive causing intestinal perforations if more than one is swallowed at any given time.  I have personally cared for a teenager who was trying to simulate a lip ring and swallowed two magnets.  He wound up in the operating room to have them surgically removed when they became lodged in his small intestine.  He was fortunate to not have been perforated but wound up being hospitalized for a week and had invasive surgery.  This was not a small child but rather someone who should have known not to put non food items in his mouth.  Now imagine how tempting they would be for a toddler!  I dread getting a phone call from the emergency room about a child who swallowed these magnets because since they are so small, they quickly pass out of the stomach and out of the reach of an endoscope.  This practically ensures a surgical procedure.  Now if a small child or a frightened child swallows these and the parents are unaware, he/she can quickly perforated and become septic.  I realize the company that makes these will be seriously affected by the ban.  But how many children need to suffer and die before actions are taken to protect them? Package warning labels are completely ineffective since small children can't read and most parents don't realize how dangerous these magnets are.. Even the most hyper vigilant parent can't possibly watch their children every second of every day.  I see children swallow things they shouldn't all the time (even my own) but very few things cause the extent of damage that these magnets do in such a short time.  Please ban them.

For some perspective, on average 5 American children a day will die daily from choking on food, (hot dogs are a known choking hazard, and don't require warnings.) 30 children will drown in buckets every year in the US. And there have been more American skate board deaths in 2011, than magnet sphere injuries in the past 3 years. There are many more products that shouldn't be handled by children, and cause far more injuries that CPSC doesn't take issue with.   The CPSC is a necessary organization in the protection of consumers. But by pushing for an unfair ban that's drastically inconsistant with the hazards of other products, the CPSC wastes federal tax dollars, and dilutes the strength, power, and reputation of their organization. Not only do they endanger a product with proven educational, theraputic and artistic benefits, they endanger your rights and liberties. The CPSC has the power to immediately stop targeting the magnet sphere industry, and if thousands of Americans voiced their concerns, they would be forced to listen.  The CPSC may have the best intentions in trying to protect kids, but a one size fits all ban is not the right way to go about it. Just as is the case with firearms, swimming pools, and balloons, the solution to the safety problem is education and not prohibition. When it comes to product safety, every one of the links is responsible: companies, parents, children.   This is why I am asking the US CPSC to *retract the stop-sale and recall requests of magnet spheres.*"", 'This seems to be a rather symbolic gesture in response to an increase in injuries from a new, popular novelty toy.  The magnets have a certain risk to consumers, but it seems like a fairly drastic step to ban them outright.  The number of things that are electric shock/choking/strangulation/slip-trip-fall hazards far outnumber any real threat these magnets have.    According to the CDC, there are approximately 2 million poison exposures in the United States each year (57 percent amont children under the age of six).  30 children die each year due to accidental poisonings.  So within the past three years: 1700 hospitalizations from these magnets vs 6 million poison exposures, 90 deaths.    It appears as though this is a knee-jerk reaction to something that has caused a fairly miinimal amount of injuries compared to other hazards.  I generally scoff at any mention of a ""nanny state"" but banning small magnets because they cause injury when used not for their intended purpose seems extreme and reactionary.    I think most people would agree that working towards solutions for actual problems that plague society is a better use of time than performing symbolic gestures.', 'Bucky Balls are a learning toy.  Label the heck out of em! Make people sign a waiver before they purchase! Do whatever it takes but don\'t ban them!

But these are different! They are captivating for kids and adults, and they inspire curiosity in virtually everyone who holds them. That is a good thing.', ""I do not believe the outright banning of Small Rare Earth Magnets (henceforth referred to as SREMs) is an appropriate response to the situation.    Comparing the cases listed in the document of injury due to interaction with SREMs to reports of injury from other items, ones which are actually intended for children, lends to the opinion that they do not pose a great threat to the safety of our society.    At the very least, they do not pose as great a threat as children's bicycles and skateboards (assuming that the safety standards already in place for the SREMs are continued).  There are hundreds of thousands of injuries as well as hundreds of deaths from those activities, but they are not outright banned as this document proposes we do for SREMs.  I suggest further consideration into both methods of detecting when SREMs are used improperly and become hazardous, as well as steps to take when such situations do occur.  Banning SREMs will not solve the problem of parent not educating themselves and their children on proper handling of things   In conclusion, I suggest more emphasis be placed on teaching parents to properly understand and take head of provided warnings, rather than target each and every item which could be hazardous to children when used improperly."", ""Many more kids are injured or killed while climbing trees or playing on furniture or riding their by bicycles biter don't outlaw sofas or melt down all the skateboards and bicycles.

The argument used are equally applicable to common household items -- small hardware (nails), stationery (thumbtacks), prescription medicines, household cleaners, etc.  All of these items are commonly available in just about any household and present a risk of being found and ingested by children. However, none of these are being banned or restricted in any significant way. At best, mild restraints are put in place (e.g., childproof medicine containers), but in general, it is assumed that the adults in a household are responsible for keeping these items out of reach of children.  Strong magnets are not significantly more dangerous than prescription medicine or strong household cleaners, and do not warrant such strong measures if these other items, which are much more readily available items and thus have a higher probability of being ingested, are not controlled in a similar fashion.', ""Constantly pandering to the lowest common denominator has not been an effective strategy before nor will it be now.

Zoos and  circuses do not provide elephants with the conditions they require for their health  and well-being. The Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide  elephants with adequate space. Neither zoos nor circuses currently meet this  requirement.In too many zoos and circuses, elephants suffer not only from lack of  space, but from unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause  a range of preventable ailments ? including painful arthritis, foot disease,  reproductive and digestive disorders, and neurotic behaviors such as swaying and  head bobbing.

It is my belief that animals such as  elephants need strict regulation to protect them from untrained and uncaring  individuals and companies.  Unfortuanately, as you are aware elephants are kept  as novelties in zoos, circuses, and other situations which often results in their  mistreatment.  Elephants too often suffer from maltreatment and disregard for their  health, safety and general well-being for greed and profit.  This is wrong and must  be corrected by those in a position to do so.  Elephants are beautiful, intelligent  creatures who can suffer the same emotional and physical trauma as you or I.

With all of the research that has been done about  them, we as an informed society, know what it would take to make a suitable  environment for these majestic animals. However, due to greed and apathy no one  seems to care about the emotional and physical wellbeing of these animals. They  require so much space and freedom to thrive and no one seems to care about  giving that to them.

They are wonderful, intelligent, amazing, social and sensitive animals  and are treated so shabbily and shamefully in zoos, circuses and the like. I\'ve  been corresponding with the St. Louis Zoo about a poor elephant named Clara,  who, because she has been trapped in a small cement and metal cage, unable to  move around, now has advanced arthritis. She is receiving no medical care. She  has another 20 to 30 years of life left, yet, the Zoo is content to let her die of  neglect.  She is in terrible physical and emotional pain. However, the Zoo has  used her up and is abandoning her. The letter I got back from the Director was  filled with fibs and rationalizations and not one shred of concern. Here in San  Diego, some years ago, our ""world famous Zoo"" enjoyed some very unpleasant  publicity when the head elephant ""handler"" was found to have abused the  elephants in his care with his bayonet-like hook that all elephant trainers seem to  use. The elephants he maimed had visible scars. The Director of the Zoo showed  the TV reporter the angry letters he\'d received and spoke of the Zoo\'s commitment  to the animals\' welfare. Right. The vicious animal handler, however, was not fired. I  am furious when I hear about elephants finally going berserk at a circus or petting  Zoo, where they are routinely abused, worked to death, chained, forced to live in a  totally unnatural environment...and then, they are shot. Who are the real villains?  Not the elephants, who didn\'t sign on for these miserable gigs!  Where is their  protection?  They can\'t count on their exploiters and abusers.', 'Elephants belong in the wild!  Failing that, conditions where they live should be as close to natural as it is  possible to make them.

Currently they do not provide adequate conditions for elephants' health  and well-being. The Animal Welfare act requires that zoos and circuses provide  elephants with adequate space; neither complies with this requirement.  Sadly, in most zoos and especially circuses, elephants suffer from lack of space,  unnatural conditions, and social deprivation that can cause a variety of ailments.  These include arthritis, foot disease, and reproductive probl","the pleasure of learning from the staff about the animals in their care. I have enjoyed the Sea Lion swim and the natural swim program, more than once. Both swim programs start with an educational and safety lesson. These are necessary for both inexperienced and experienced swimmers as the lessons provide solid information about the animals included in the programs, and safety information it relates to animal and swimmer. Every safety precaution is taken.   I have swum with Bottlenose dolphins of different ages in the natural swim. Not only was this particular swim fun and a learning experience for me, but it was for the dolphins also.    I have sat on a platform with a sea lion pressing her large tusked and whiskered fact on my cheek for a kiss. I was keenly aware of the size and strength of that sea lion. Her caretaker/trainer ensured me that I was safe. The caretaker/trainer, with his vast knowledge and experience with that animal, was all I need to know everything was ok. THIS is what APHIS needs to know.   Every caretaker/trainer I have spent time with in and out of the water was someone whose knowledge and experience I trusted.   It worries me that the radicalized animals rights people want to shut down all marine mammal facilities under their misinformed and misguided ""empty the tanks"" rant. These people know nothing about the day-to-day operations or a marine mammal facility, nor do they care to. They do not know or want to know of the rescue and rehab work these places engage in when needed. They merely sit at their keyboards and pound away a diatribe that holds know education, knowledge or experience in marine mammals or marine mammal care.   I spent seven years as a volunteer with a marine mammal rescue and rehab organization. I have put my time in with the caretakers and trainers from different marine mammal facilities, including SeaWorld. Would I trust my own animal, if I had one, to be cared for by these professionals? Yes. Without doubt. Because it is their level of care, their compassion, their education and professionalism that keeps the marine mammals healthy and happy every day.   Thank you for opportunity to comment on this proposal. In closing, please keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with the way marine mammal facilities in the US are run.', ""People can only love and protect the beings they know.

Please geel free to contact me personally if you have any questions.', 'I have been a professional animal trainer for 17 years. As a member and past president of the Animal Behavior Management Alliance (ABMA),  an organization representing individuals who have dedicated their professional lives to providing daily care, enrichment, and training to all animal taxa in a zoological, laboratory, or domestic settings, I can assure you that our members\' first priority is to act as the guarantors of the welfare of those in their charge.    ABMA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.  After reviewing the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.    If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.  Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis.  Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s welfare.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.    Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.   I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing exemplary care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'I strongly support updating the animal welfare laws for marine mammals. I actually would like for the end of captivity of marine mammals. However, the update does address deficiencies in the current law. Chief among these is the lack of oversight of ""swim with dolphins"" programs, which have been unregulated since 1999. I would like to strongly support more oversight for these dolphins care in these settings. Also, while the proposed rule does not make any significant changes to the minimum space requirements for the primary habitat for marine mammals which really seems essential to add, it does require that sufficient shade be provided for animals in outdoor pools to allow all animals to take shelter from direct sunlight.

I mean I would hate to see if my Grandparents would have to give up the ranch that is on third generation with the original homestead still owned by the family.   Plus, main reason in why there are not many ranches producing more beef than what they did in the past is that people keep buying up the prime farm or ranch land (aka subdivision).  This causes us to try to produce the same amount on smaller amounts of land which is not going to happen because range can only handle certain stocking rates.  So if the government was smart they would try to protect the farm and ranch land that we currently have that isn't under concrete.      The second reason is why take a chance of introducing Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) back into the US is just pain irresponsible.  These would concern me because that would be taking a chance that we would lose a lot of US cattle including my own.  However FMD doesn't only affect cattle it basically  affects any animals with hooves like deer, sheep, and pigs.  So you would be taking a chance in affecting multiple industries.  Another thing whether I can personally get foot and mouth from infected animals and meat if that is case then hell no about importing beef.   I know that they would have to let us know about the outbreak if happen but I don't trust them since they already haven't told us about cows die of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) twice.   As the saying goes fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  So I wouldn't trust in Brazil letting us know about anything.  That would scare the heck of me about the meat in the grocery store which I only get every great once in a while.  There is a reason why I raise my own beef and not buy from the grocery stores.  I know what is in that beef.  I just hope the government makes a wise decision and all I have to say is that they need to listen to the people and not just themselves."", 'All nations should strive for self sufficiency in their food supply, and stay away from importing ~  Be safe.', ""Paul from Rocking A Ranch.

The proposed changes set forth by the Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) puts the United States at risk for contracting foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and does not benefit the economy in any major way. It is imperative that the risk versus reward analysis is taken into great consideration in order to secure the health of United States citizens. Up to this point, sufficient research has not been conducted in regards to cost-benefit analysis.   Although the APHIS considers the likelihood of exposure to FMD-infected species is low, the consequence assessment conducted shows severe potential impacts. Reported in the risk analysis conducted by the APHIS, The consequence of an FMD outbreak in the U.S. would be extremely highDepending on the magnitude of the outbreak and the eradication strategy, the sum of consumer impacts, direct costs and trade losses over a 25-year period, would be between US$37 billion to US$42 billion (in 2011 dollars) (APHIS, 8). FMD is still prevalent in some countries in South America and consequently there is risk of reintroduction. As a beef consumer, I do not want to consume beef that could have originated from, or commingled with, animals from affected neighboring areas.   I do not see that the benefits out weigh the costs. Not only do domestic producers take a minimal hit from foreign competition but also the United States does face a risk of contracting FMD. The United States should not be importing meat and animal products from countries that the APHIS does not consider free of FMD.  From an economic standpoint, international trade generally does benefit both countries that engage in trade.  However, because the producers will only sustain a 0.01 percent decrease in production this means the importation of beef will barely affect the United States beef economy. Yet, the risk and potential damage to human health and future trade could be very high.  For a logical and rational person, the risks of this endeavor far out-weight the benefits.  I cannot express my opposition to this amendment enough, why take such a great risk for so little reward?   If the Department of Agriculture decides to proceed with proposed changes - stringent labeling requirements should be implemented, ensuring that meat is accurately labeled with the country of origin. Consumers should be allowed to make a well-educated decision on which meat they choose to buy. The Department of Agriculture should also consider a plan to ensure that Brazilian methods of production are in coordination with U.S. standards and regulations.   The APHIS suggests that the continuation of current regulations will result in no change in the potential impact on the human environment. With the current regulation in place the United States has maintained low disease risks and negligible environmental effects. I believe the high-risk potentials are a strong deterrent and are sufficient for continuing the restriction on the importation of Brazilian beef.', 'I feel that this proposal to import fresh and chilled beef from 14 states in Brazil is anti-American, irresponsible and dangerous.

Likewise, I opposed the creation of a new research facility in Kansas, near countless stocker and cow-calf operators, to replace Plum Island.  As one of the last outbreaks in the U.K. was linked to a nearby HMD research facility, I am skeptical as to our ability to prevent something from going wrong.  As I tell my ""kids"": 1. Have a contingency plan in case something goes wrong. and 2. Something always goes wrong. Finally, as a rancher who must consider the possibility that I may be biased due to economics, I have kept these cows through drought, ice storms, heat waves, floods that washed out fences, frozen my nose and toes, pulled calves in the mud at 2:00 A.M., fed in darkness for weeks on end, and all the rest of the usual hardships we face.

Why are we required to ID our livestock and secure a safe supply and on the other hand import beef from an area where a known, very infectious disease, is present?

By no means am i an expert on the topic but it looks to me like one of the worlds largest international meat packers is trying to strong arm the USDA into this sweet arrangement where they bring in high risk beef from Brazil purchased and raised dirt cheap and mark them up to your local grocery stores. In the mean time your american based farmers will be forced to take a major hit, declare bankruptcy or even feed them personally and export their product if that's their only option to come out on the plus side. Another angle to look at is that it is a win win scenario for the major packers who will not only be making a killing off of Brazil but also buying the same cattle here significantly cheaper than in years past. Personally i would like to see the American beef producer thrive and generate the necessary income to expand and serve nothing but a safe, quality product raised on our own soil, benefiting our economy from the ground up. If you look at raising a calf from step one to the dinner plate there is a lot of money trading hands before the animal is even conceived. Just a quick scenario that could take place...So i want to get in the cattle business all of the sudden...I am going to first have to either buy or lease land (taxable), go out and purchase a set of cows (valued from one to two thousand dollars), go buy enough bulls to guarantee all of your females conceive, buy all necessary vaccines and means to keep the animals alive (this can get very expensive and again taxable), and most importantly buy the necessary feed to keep them moving.

The inherent risk of an inanimate object being dangerous due to misuse is prevalent in all products, not exclusive to magnets. This level of regulation will not reduce the chances of someone ingesting a ferrous substance since magnetism exists in nearly all facets of modern, industrial use.  Have we, as a society, stooped to a level where every item and tool must be checked for sharp edges, consumable sizes, and likelihood of causing the most minute of damages? How would it appear on a global front, that our country has such a poor education that our population is incapable of basic survival? The solution to the cited incidents through banning will be ineffective and and non-permanent.

All of us recognize that just about everything we encounter in life could be a potential danger if used in the wrong way (toothpicks, sharpened pencils, razor blades--the list goes on).

Many purchasable items which have specific safe applications of use may also be used in ways which may lead to serious injury or even death. Specifically if the unadvised method of use is ingestion, the list of purchasable items which may lead to serious injury or even death is nearly infinite. Granted, many of these purchasable items (including magnet sets sold by companies such as Zen Magnets) are sold with warnings against ingestion and against the use of the item by children. As example, it would be silly to ban cleaning agents from the consumer market because a subset of the population uses them to achieve an inexpensive albeit dangerous high despite the clear warnings.

Here we have a product marketed towards adults, that is now being banned due to a relatively low injury rate (as stated in another comment) which is .06%, taking into account injuries that occured before warning labels and better consumer education went in place.

I understand guns, that is not under their control.  However, on the CSPC website there is a ton of information and studies on the dangers of pools/tubs and the huge numbers of child deaths that I was not aware of until now.

Circus elephants have it the worst; they often are made to stand in chains for 21  hours a day, and most of the year they must travel in uncomfortable boxcars in  extreme temperatures, standing in their own waste. Zoo animals are also subject  to chaining and confinement. Circuses and many zoos control elephants through  unnecessary and cruel instruments such as bullhooks, whips, clubs, and electric  shock devices. These must be outlawed.  There are two refuges in America that provide natural environments for elephants:  The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the Performing Animal Welfare Society  (PAWS) sanctuary in California. They both provide hundreds of thousands of acres  for elephants to roam and socialize naturally, as they would in the wild, and live a  healthy, stress-free life. Exhibitors of elephants must be required to provide such  habitats for them."", 'To whom it may concern:  While many of us may appreciate the appropriate display of select charismatic megafauna in zoos and other venues for the purposes of education, it has become increasingly clear over the years that a number of facilities have chosen to display elephants in order to increase the number of visitors. Unfortunately, it has also become clear that the size of these animals is not always dealt with in an appropriate fashion, causing the animals to suffer.  While this sort of thing may have been acceptable decades in the past, we have learned a great deal as to the nature of these animals and the degree to which they suffer as a function of their confines. While some zoos and entertainment venues contend that their facilities are adequate, it is clear that a few- perhaps one or two- have enough space to allow natural, relatively unconfined behavior. In the absence of adequacy, elephants are reduced to walking on concrete, or are held in tiny patches of earth- frequently only during those months of the year when it is sufficiently warm. Still others reduce elephants to being used for entertainment such as for rides, as with Six Flags Marine World, whose flatly inexcusable trail of elephant mortality should have caused them to lose whatever licenses they have by now. Equally unacceptable is the confinement of solitary animals such as that kept at the Alaska Zoo, which must be kept indoors for months at a time.  For too long the emphasis has been on maintaining elephants as if they were livestock, rather than highly sensitive and remarkably intelligent charges that demand far more space and specialized care than can be maintained at the majority of facilities that currently tend to these animals in the United States. I urge you to take action requiring dramatically increased outdoor space per animal, as well as improved facilities for indoor storage when and where necessary. I recommend comments as put forth by In Defense of Animals to be something we can strive for in order to properly care for those elephants maintained in captivity.', 'All animals need better treatment and people to speak out for them. Animal  activists are not terrorists!!!', 'Elephants do NOT belong in circuses AT ALL and should be released from ALL  circuses in the United States to approved humane sanctuaries, where they will get  the proper nutrition/medical care, dignity, respect and love that these massive  giants deserve.  Elephants do  not belong in zoos, either.  However, if a zoo  follows and obeys the Animal Welfare Act and provides many acres of ground for  elephants to roam free, with natural foliage/trees that mimics the elephants natural  habitat in the wild, then that is acceptable.    As it is today, most zoos provide scant space for elephants, most of it is on  concrete, where they become arthritic and suffer pain, social deprivation, unnatural  conditions, and forced abnormal behavior by brutal forms of abuse.  Wild  elephants live in familial groups headed by a matriarch, babies stay with their  mothers over two years, they travel many miles a day on the ground, NOT  CONCRETE.   All forms of torture should be explicitly banned such as bullhooks,  tasers, stun guns, whips, chains and domination.  Elephants should NEVER be  made to ""perform"" for the amusement of humans.  They should not be locked in  barns,  stalls or other small enclosures.  They should have a veterinarian and  animal nutritionist trained specifically in elephant medical care, who is aware of  the many foot problems that can affect these massive animals in captivity.  In short, unless a zoo is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and expense to  provide elephants everything they need in a natural environment, then the zoo  should be forced to release their elephants to The Elephant Sanctuary in TN or the  PAWS in CA.  I happen to be a long-time donating member of both charitable  organizations.', 'I am commenting on the issue related to elephant care of captive elephants for the  following reasons: 1) Zoos and circuses do not provide elephants with the conditions they require for  their health and well-being.  The Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and  circuses provide elephants with adequate space. Neither zoos nor circuses  currently meet this requirement.   2) In too many zoos and circuses, elephants suffer not only from lack of space,  but from unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause a range  of preventable ailments ? including painful arthritis, foot disease, reproductive and  digestive disorders, and neurotic behaviors such as swaying and head bobbing.   3) An estimated half of all captive elephants suffer from arthritis and foot disease,  and these ailments are the leading cause of euthanasia in captive elephants.  Circus elephants are often subjected to prolonged chaining, spending up to 21  hours a day standing in chains and more than 11 months of the year traveling in  train boxcars, where they are again chained, and forced to endure extreme  temperatures and to stand for hours in their own waste. Many zoo elephants are  also subjected to prolonged chaining, and to confinement in barn stalls for  extended periods of time.   4) Circuses and many zoos control their elephants through force, domination, and  aggressive use of the bullhook and other tools of intimidation such as whips,  clubs, and electric shock devices. These instruments are unnecessary and must  be outlawed.   5) Exhibitors of elephants must be required to provide large, naturalistic  environments similar to those at The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the  Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) sanctuary in California. These two  refuges provide hundreds to thousands of acres over which elephants can roam,  socialize and maintain their health.', 'I think that the use of bullhooks on elephants should be made illegal.  I also think  that to chain up an elephant is cruel and legislation should be made that limits the  amount of time an elephant can be chained or housed alone.  Elephants live inteh  wild in herds and when they are alone they get stressed and upset.  Sometimes  they go mad and stand their lifeless or exhibit self destructive behavior.   ANyone who owns an elephant should be required to provide it with a large area of  land to roam on.  They should be housed in accomodations that simulate their  natural environment and should never be kept alone.  They should have access to  a variety of enrichment activities and materials to keep them mentally nourished.   Furthermore, there should be strict fines and punishments imposed for owners  who do not comply withe these standards.  Elephants are beautiful, intelligent  creatures and they should be treated with the utmost repect and care.  Their lives  should be made as normal as possible so that they can live a  life that closely  resembles the one they would have had in the wild.  It is our duty as citizens and  lawmakers that their welfare is looked after.', ""Elephants don't belong in the circus or in a Zoo that can't provide enough space or  care for such large animals.  The use of force, i.e., bullhooks, chains, electric  hotshots, and other instruments, are clearly inhumane and should be a very strong  indicator that these animals do not do well in enforced captivity.  Their life spans  are shorter and there have been more and more instances of elephants rebelling  and hurting people.  Of course, it's the animal, who has been so abused, that pays  the ultimate price.  Please do all you can to help these intelligent animals."", 'I am deeply committed to our planet, to the wild places, wild life and  elements/components that matter - because of their functionality (our human  sustenance and continued life on Earth) and their intrinsic beauty.  But mostly for  their beauty.  We all know that once humans screw everything up and there is no  more HUMAN life on Earth, there will be life on Earth, it just won\'t look like it does  now or include us.  Meanwhile, there is growing awareness, albeit a little late, that we have a mandate  to change our behavior to hopefully offset what is now termed ""global warming,""  among other things.    I have been an environmentalist all my life.  It started at a young age because my  parents would take us on vacations that consisted of places like Sequoia National  Park, Kings Canyon, Yosemite, Mammoth, Big Sur, Carmel, etc.  I was blessed  then and still am now that I have my own family.  We try to do the same type of  trips with our daughter.  My love for Earth has always infused me with deep passion and unspeakable  rapture - a sense that our Earth is our Heaven on Earth - that the places I love so  much are the cathedrals in which I could not only find God, but find my love for all  things natural - including humans and other animals.    Not surprisingly, my mother - 50% of the inspiration known as my parents - picked  up and brought in every stray animal near the hills where we lived in Southern  California.    Our devotion to our pet cats and dogs was probably not too unusual,  but she, like I, became increasingly more aware and concerned after learning  about primates from Dr. Leaky and his family and chimps from Jane Goodall.  She  became an activist and began with first educating herself and becoming a docent  at the Los Angeles Zoo.  Eventually, she became a specialist in endangered  species and the elected docent chair with GLAZA, the Greater Los Angeles Zoo  Association.    My devotion and dedication to animals and all things environmental really became  imprinted when I saw, in the early seventies, footage of a whale being harpooned  and the crazy Greenpeace activists putting themselves in danger to try to protect  it.  Something clicked in my head and said these guys are the heroes of the  world.  The corporations of today might call them ""terrorists,"" as they are  interfering with a money making venture.  However, I have always seen the  terrorists as the whalers - be they Norwegian, Japanese, or from Spain - the  results are the same - the beautiful and gloriously graceful beings have been  brutally murdered - and put on the brink of extinction - by us humans...  And it isn\'t  necessary or morally without penalty.    We, as the dominant beings on this planet, are creating an imbalanced world by  not observing common, natural law.  And that is that we must observe the natural  web that exists if we are to continue to exist.  Ultimately, it is that simple.  We  have everything to loose if we do not stop and reassess our behavior and  arrogance.  We must or it will kill us.  So it is that I approach this particular docket APHIS-2006-0044.  All animals are  magnificent and none more important or special then the next.  However, there are  few more sweet and loving and family orientated than the Elephant.  They are  special and dear to me and to so many.  I am seriously upset about the recent  death of Rosie at the Los Angeles Zoo and my mother would have been an active  part of protesting Rosie\'s situation - along with the other two - at the LA Zoo and  would have been in total pain and anger had she learned about the regrettable and  avoidable loss.    Elephants are very social - namely they love their children, their friends and their  mates.  They love to go out for long walks together.  They love to play and do as  they please.  Just like us.  Containment in areas that do not allow this not only  dampens their spirits but is actually detrimental to their health.  Just like it would  be for us.    One of the things my mother knew is that Zoos are problematic, too.  Learning  about endangered species, she saw the need to have places to educate and  inspire people about animals but she also saw the problems associated with  putting an animal - a free, living thing, behind bars for the sake of our education or,  worse, entertainment.  I learned how circuses are evil for the treatment of the  animals (namely the elephants) and how inhumanely and even sadistically they  are handled so that there will be a ""show tonight.""   It is a crime against our  humanity, if you will, to mistreat another being.  It should be a crime to destroy the  habitats that wild animals need to survive if not thrive.  And it is a crime to put  something as large as an elephant in a contained site and have them chained for  any length of time.  This is an outrage!  And on behalf of my mother, I ask that we  create laws that punish animal abusers for a long, long time.    In the case of Elephants, which are so unique in size and are specific not just to  zoos, but to circuses, we should create new laws that govern their management  and wellbeing.  We are responsible for their death and demise if we do not take an  extreme stand on their behalf as they are not designed for the manner in which  they are presented when in a zoo or a circus.  We are more advanced and have  become more conscience about animals over the last 100 years as we see them  more than prey or entertainment, but as essential to the web of our lives and as  part of the whole that we are included in.    I ask that we mandate all elephants currently in zoos and circuses be moved to  the elephant sanctuary and or the one in California.  We also must recognize that  the businesses that do this, voluntarily hopefully, and by court order if necessary,  be given some type of acknowledgement - either a financial reward or  governmental grant of some kind - something to compensate them and recognize  their great commitment to the beautiful struggle known as animal awareness and  stewardship.  It is time that we reevaluate our relationship to this Earth and our  four legged, winged, and fish.  It would be a great new day when we are deeply  committed to our planet and its entire population - not just our own.  Thank you.   PS - So, to be brief, at the end, I do not believe that we should be shipping and  storing Elephants, period.  They should be kept in the wild because of their simple  yet specific needs.  Space.  Family.  And no harsh treatment by humans.', ""I'm Asking the USDA to create tough new standards, and institute  the following:  ? The use of bullhooks should be prohibited.

Please help the elephants maintian their exsistence.', 'I?m appalled by the exploitation of the elephants by zoos and circuses. The cruelty and deprivation of the elephants in circuses is obvious to everyone  who has even a speck of compassion and reason, but the zoos don?t fare better. After the death of the 3 elephants at LPZ  which, I hope, will never get a permit to  house another elephant, I visited a few other zoos to compare their enclosures. Here are my observations:  The Brookfield zoo prides itself to have a miserable .25 acre ? a joke! The winter enclosures are not much bigger then the average living room and that?s  the standard for the elephants in cold climates ?any the zoos which have to house  the elephants indoor during cold winter months should not be allowed to keep  elephants at all.  The Omaha?s zoo elephants looked so parched on a hot summer afternoon (Sep.  2005);  Tiny water holes and droplets of water from the hose are definitely not enough for  the elephants ? and why the two were separated?  Hogle zoo, Salt Lake City, might be a showcase for a public, but does not offer  much space for the elephants and certainly not for Hi-Dari,  a lonely, older elephant separated from the two younger ones by a high fence and  still living in her old, tiny space ? a typical example of incompabilities between the  elephants who have no choices of companionships in all too small, unnatural  enclosures and groupings that the zoos offer them.  The elephants in Wildlife Safari, Winston OR looked by far the best, even though they offer controversial elephants? rides; still, their living area is much too small.  The elephants in Oakland zoo had the most of space  (the male was not on a display). Even though this was the only zoo that didn?t make me cringe from disgust, the  poor history of breeding, the tragic deaths of many calves in this as many other  zoos proves that the elephants don?t belong in the zoos.   Portland zoo left the impression of outright cruelty to elephants: Small, barren enclosure for the females on one hand,  the male banging his head against the metal door was shocking and horrifying.   It is obvious that the zoos drive the elephants (as well as other animals) to  neurosis as well as cause their premature death. As a daughter of a veterinarian and being married to one I have seen many cases  of cruel treatment of animals and, to my mind, the lives of elephants in both,  circuses and zoos, are not only sad but cruel. Unless USDA intervenes, bans the elephants from the circuses altogether,  forces the zoos to drastically increase the space and improve the enclosures,  the elephants will continue to suffer a sad and tragic consequences.', 'This is just one last plea for these poor elephants who have been kidnapped from  the wild, chained, and brutalized into submission by the wildlife pimps of the world  for their own financial gain.

Let us not shame  this great country of America by denying these living, feeling creatures their right  to live in peace.  Sweden, Austria, Costa Rica, India, Finland, and Singapore have  all banned or restricted the use of animals in entertainment?it?s time for the U.S.  to do the same.

I do not believe that any animal being severly  beaten and living in spaces that do not conform to their needs is appropriate.

Zoos cannot  accommodate an elephant's"," moved to the area, I began volunteering at DRC and saw first hand the individual care given to the marine mammals who call this place their forever home.  I monitored hundreds of guest encounters as a volunteer and have never seen any problems occurring from there being more than one dolphin participating in an in-water encounter with one trainer.  Our trainers are all professionals who have personal relationships with every one of our dolphins and can read their behavior so well that they know how to manage each encounter.  The dolphins also enjoy when they can work together to give a dorsal pull or imitation.  We never ask a dolphin to participate unless they want to do so and I can honestly say that I have seen this to be true.  The dolphins are enriched by their experiences together and with our guests.  I continued to volunteer here because I am an animal lover and I could tell that this family of dolphins was happy and healthy and that the staff made this their priority.    I have also participated in the in-water encounters both as a guest and as a practice for training. I have probably done more than 30 in water programs.  At no time when there were 2 dolphins working with one trainer did I feel it wasn't safe.  It was great to see the dolphins choose to cooperate and take turns.  The trainer each time was experienced and loving with the dolphins and both the guests and dolphins had a great time.  I have heard over and over from our guests that they had a life changing experience when interacting with our dolphin family. Many of our guests who interact with the dolphins come back again and again.  The dolphins here at DRC are fortunate to live in a natural water lagoon. Sometimes the water is murky or choppy and some days it is clear. This is part of living in the natural lagoon.  Some of our lagoons are very deep which is also great for the dolphins because they can dive, which is something they love to do. Some of the lagoons are so deep that we cannot see to the bottom.  This has never been a safety issue or a concern to the participants or staff.   We can always see when the dolphins are interacting with the guests. This is always done above the water or on the surface.  The deep lagoons are especially fun for the guests and dolphins when the dolphins are imitating the guests while bobbing up and down.  The guest goes up and down on a platform but the dolphin bobs up and down all the way from the bottom which takes a lot longer!  Quite fun for both!  Because of the excellent care and love the staff shows the dolphin family, I began working at DRC full time. I believe there is not any other place like DRC. The animals' care is our priority. We always put our animals' welfare first. Our animals are our family. This caring and love is apparent to our guests.  When our guests come and make personal connections with the animals in our family, they are more likely to encourage conservation and support our dolphins' cousins in the wild.  By educating the public and facilitating these personal connections, I feel that we are contributing to marine mammals' welfare all over the world.

Having aquariums such as the Georgia Aquarium, Shedd Aquarium, and SeaWorld, I was given the opportunity to explore and fall in love with the ocean and all of its creatures. I was able to see up close and personal what a Beluga whale looked like, what they felt like, and learn all kinds of amazing things about these creatures that I would have never known and no one would have without having them under human care. Having zoos and aquariums have given me a love and appreciation for animals that I never would have had. I now am an animal trainer, working at Dolphin Quest.

I'm pleased that this revision to the marine mammal regulations is being considered as there have been many scientific advancements during the past 20 years. As a result, our knowledge of marine mammals has increased exponentially.  My comments are as follows: 1)\tNoise and its impact on marine mammal hearing and well-being is not addressed. Marine mammals have hearing capabilities far exceeding humans. Ideally baseline noise levels within tanks, pools and other settings should be performed and monitored.  Upcoming resources that can assist with development of guidelines should be available by the end of this month. See NOAA's Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammals. http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/acoustics/guidelines.htm  2)\tEnrichment is another aspect that is not addressed in the docket (yet should be) as marine mammals live complex social lives in the wild. While many licensed facilities have excellent enrichment programs, not all do. Every effort must be made to ensure the animals are stimulated mentally and physically.  3)\tShade is crucial for the well-being of marine mammals in order to protect their skin, eyes and is important for thermoregulation. \tIf natural or artificial features are to be used instead of erecting shade structures, then areas housing marine mammals must have shade available to the animals throughout the day.  \tWhile there may be shading in the early morning, many features cannot provide shade through the entire day.  \tSWTD program have an even more important role in providing ample shade as the dolphins heads are out of the water for long periods of time during interactions.  4)\tWater quality and what's considered acceptable has evolved considerably over the last 20 years.  \tAs noted in the docket, sterilization of water is no longer a desired outcome as it can in turn cause disease by compromising immune function. \tA healthy water microbiome is critical and being able to see with absolute clarity is likely not possible if algae and other organisms are allowed to exist.  \tIn addition to Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, consider adding Clostridium perfringens as an additional test.  \tIn interconnected pools exist, all pools should be sampled as water flow is not consistent  \tParticular attention should be paid to pools with angular edges that may harbor dead spaces and poor water circulation.

During the time I have worked at DRC, I have participated in a number of interactive programs and also spent many of my lunch hours watching sessions between the dolphins, sea lions and their trainers. The mutual affection between the mammals and the trainers is very evident. It is clear to me that the dolphins participate in the sessions for their own enjoyment.   When I participated in interactive programs I did not feel that my safety was ever at risk, even when one trainer worked with more than one dolphin at a time.  Nor do I feel that the natural water environment and deep lagoon added any risk to my safety during the relatively short periods of time when the trainer and I might not be able to see the dolphins. I have learned so much about the animals, the environment, and the importance of conservation mostly from narrated sessions that go on throughout the day.  They have inspired me to improve my personal actions in my daily life and in my support of the environment around me. I have become avid about reducing, reusing and recycling.

I am thankful that the agency cares about the animals\' welfare; however, some of the proposed changes will limit our ability to provide exceptional care for the animals. I have been an IMATA member for several years. Everyone at my facility, Oceans of Fun, and all other US marine mammal facilities always put the animals\' welfare first. I have been at the Oceans of Fun Hershey Park location for the past seven years. In the past the show at Hershey had been very theatrical with other marine mammal companies. Oceans of Fun\'s goal is to educate guest about these animals in the wild and how we can all do our part to preserve their species as well as their natural habitat. Since Oceans of Fun has been in Hershey we have been able to change the mentality of the guests who enter our facility and inspire thousands to do their part. I feel privileged to be making such an impact with the help of these amazing animals. Recently we interacted with a child who was inspired by our presentation. She was assigned as a school project to research a topic she cared about. She felt so strongly to help these animals she decided to write her paper about seals and sea lions and how people can help them. She contacted Oceans of Fun and came in to learn and experience a day of a trainer, and learn how she could teach her friends about these animals. She was amazed by the exceptional care the animals receive on a daily basis and how much dedication the trainers have.   The proposed changes relating to marine mammals will not benefit the animals themselves. As trainers, we all know our animals and how they each have different needs. To limit the amount of daily interactive time, or changing the requirements of trainer/ animal ratios will negatively impact the variety that can be experienced on a daily basis. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care. Trainers ensure that all animal interactions are positive for themselves, the animals, as well as any guests.   As a trainer I have dedicated my life to these animals. In many ways the animals I care for come before my family. I have spent countless, holidays, nights, and almost every weekend of my life caring for the animals. This job is so much part of my life, that even when I am not physically at work, mentally I am always thinking about their needs and well-being.   Without the existence of accredited zoos and aquariums, many people wouldn\'t get the opportunity to experience exotic animals. In a world where people only care about what directly affects themselves, zoos and aquariums are a great way to reach out to people about what is in our world and how we are effecting it and the animals which inhabit it, but more importantly how people can act to help animals in the wild. As best said by Baba Dioum, ""In the end we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught."" I would like to thank APHIS for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you also recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and that you did not feel compelled to unnecessarily change regulations. Thank you!', 'There are certain deficiencies in the current proposed rules to update the Animal Welfare Act regarding marine mammals.  One important aspect dealing with captive dolphins is the lack of oversight of ""swim with dolphins"" programs, which have been  unregulated since 1999. Also, the proposed rules make no significant change to the minimum space requirement for the marine  mammals\' primary habitat. Overall I support the proposed rule changes, but I think they could be made even better.', 'I am from Ontario, Canada and a few months ago I attended at the Minister\'s office with a well known marine biologist to discuss with them the new Standards of Care for Marine Mammals which have since been implemented.  Many of our suggestion were entered into the Standards of Care, in particular shelter, more transparency, access to fresh air and natural sunlight and added enrichment to the tanks.  I commend you for finally updating your standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine animals, however the current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In"," export some of that top end choice product that we cannot consume elsewhere.

Despite the laudable efforts by CPSC  to educate the public about the dangers of high-powered magnet sets and manufacturers' warning labels, the rapidly increasing number of cases that are being documented are showing us that warning labels do not work in this case. Magnet ingestions and the serious, and potentially life-threatening, injuries that they cause to children are preventable, and the most effective way for preventing these ingestions in children is by banning the sale of such high-powered, high volume sets as defined in the proposed rule.   Swallowing magnets is very different from swallowing most other foreign bodies. Typically most other foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without causing damage. But in the cases of these magnets the need for surgical repair of a perforation (hole in the intestine) or fistula (tunnels between 2 parts of the intestine) is high due to the significant attraction these magnets have for each other.   These high-powered magnet sets are toys. Should we really allow children to continue to be injured for the sake of a toy? I would hope not.

There are many reasons why magnet spheres (with proper warning labels) make excellent toys for children as well.

You should also understand that even if you think these are inappropriate toys for children, there are many adults such as myself who use them to construct sculptural artwork, and would like the companies who supply us with these magnets to continue existing and supporting our work.  Would you ban the sale of chemicals used in photography because they're unsafe for children? How about dyes used in silk-screening? Surely many of those would similarly be unsafe for children to ingest.  Would you ban various pieces of sports equipment? Hockey skates and baseball bats have the potential to cause major injuries if misused.  But if the proper precautions are taken and it's properly understood what is not safe to put in one's mouth, it's quite safe to play with magnets.  Many other things which we expose children to are similarly quite potentially dangerous, if not treated with a minimum of respect required to remain safe.

Magnet ingestions and the injuries they cause to childrenwhich can include bowel perforations or fistulas, twisted bowels and severe infections, among other serious gastrointestinal injuriesare preventable. The most effective way to prevent ingestions is to ban the sale of high-powered magnet sets, as defined in the proposed rule.  Children sometimes swallow things they shouldn't, but these magnets pose special risk to children.

Far more reasonable measures could easily be taken without harming the manufacturers and importers of these adult products.  For example, restricting the sale to those stores or retail outlets that do NOT market exclusively to children (e.g. children's-only toy stores that do not sell or market items for use by those over 14, or 16, or 18).  Or, require labeling much as California's Proposition 65 does or as cigarettes are labeled to ensure those purchasing are aware that these items should not be left where children or pets could access them.  Either of these would fall in line with existing norms and expectations of the public for proper labeling of items that pose a risk if used inappropriately.   An outright ban would set a dangerous precedent for the CPSC, both in terms of the items that the public believes the CPSC have dominion over and items that are safe enough to have around children.  The current methods of restricting or labeling items not intended for children is sufficient for those items and there is no demonstrable difference with magnetic building sets as evidenced by the CPSC's own proposed rule research.  The number of reported cases is quite small, both in number and per capita based on ownership of these sets, yet the CPSC has extrapolated to a farcical number of serious incidents.   It is inappropriate to ban magnetic building sets when there are many other dangerous items (e.g. watch batteries, laundry/dishwasher detergent packs, lower-strength magnets that are more easily frangible than rare-earths) that are sold with appropriate warnings, in appropriate containers, and in appropriate locations that there is no doubt as to their intended use and yet, like many things in this world, would be dangerous to children if ingested."", 'Labeling these products designed for adults and adding a hazard warning to the boxes should be sufficient.

They\'ve organized their members to submit comments that continually repeat that ""people cannot be trusted to listen to warnings"", while never addressing the arguments against theirs. If the CPSC won\'t listen to the 85%+ public consensus against the ban, perhaps the CPSC should listen to Nancy Voice-of-Reason Nord, the CPSC\'s own most experienced commissioner, when she says:     The assumption that warnings don\'t work, undermine past safety standards deemed acceptable by the CPSC and US Congress.    The ban is overly broad. There are two distinct hazard patterns that should be addressed: Children under 5 tounging their environment, and teenagers mimicking piercings. And the ban includes products [like Zen Magnets] that have not demonstrated similar risks.    These magnets have much more utility, and lower instance of hazard than other products on the market.  The simple fact of the matter is that if magnets such as Bucky Balls and Zen Magnets are deemed a safety hazard because people cannot be trusted to follow the safety warnings, then all chemical products such as Draino, shampoo, dishwashing liquids, anti-freeze, candy flavored medicines, etc should also be banned from the markets.', ""Don't ban them bucky balls etc"", 'Magnets should not be banned and I know have less respect for the government and more respect it buckyballs and zen magnets because they are standing up for what\'s right.

These magnets are not 100% safe but we all know that. The reason there not safe is because of there size and magnetism it makes it not safe for children. So if you have kids don\'t get these and there will be no problem. So what should happen is that the companies should put a "" keep away from small children"" on whatever their selling it in.

They do not represent an unreasonable risk of injury. The judgment of the proposed rule in this matter is deeply flawed and inaccurate. Millions of households enjoy the educational value, hobby use, and entertainment from small, spherical, high-flux magnets without incident (as well as other high flux magnets that have numerous practical uses). Limits on the flux value effectively bans the product at a period when the U.S. Government is seeking to support the growth of small businesses and the middle class jobs they provide. Limits on distribution accomplishes the same effect.  Household chemicals (to pick just one category of in-home hazard) injure 120,000-160,000 people per year. They are not banned, even though many of them could easily be replaced by practical, non-toxic alternatives. The reason they are not regulated out of existence is because the government has taken the stance that freedom of commerce is a core value in this country and American should be aware of and exercise due diligence whether they are climbing a ladder, cleaning with bleach, disposing of plastic bags, or handling anything around children with small parts that can be swallowed.  Spend your resources on public education and you will have a much greater impact than you will by shuttering small businesses. Remember, these magnets are already safely used in millions of homes, and you will be more productive by increasing caution in those homes than by ending future purchases.', ""I would argue that magnetic sets are no more dangerous than many other children's toys.

These organizations have worked with the CPSC and done everything needed, and now the organization is acting in such a manner contrary to their previous prior dealings with the effected companies.  As a consumer, I think the CPSC is overreaching. Personal responsibility is key. We don\'t let children play with ball bearings, and we have not banned every magnet out there because of the potential (ab)use by children. Parents should be responsible and not let these ADULT TOYS fall within their hands.  I believe that there should be a category promulgated that is classified as an ""ADULT TOY"" wherein the CPSC can designate particularly age-inappropriate items and disallow their sale at establishments where children may express an interest.', 'As a pediatrician, I am very concerned about the risk these small and powerful magnets pose for children.  While small children can ingest and choke on many objects, these rare earth magnets pose a particular risk because they can attach to another magnet (or any other metal object) in the intestine and cause perforation, which can only be corrected by surgery.  In addition, because of their small size and shiny metal character, they are very appealing to young children.  Clearly, most parents do not intentionally let young children play with these magnets; but children are curious and like to explore and find things.  In addition, parents can easily lose or drop these magnets, inadvertently allowing young children to find them. The magnets are an entertaining toy for adults, but they serve no essential or practical purpose.  They pose a risk to young children that cannot be justified by any utility.  I urge the CPSC to ban these magnets for the safety and health of children.', 'A ban on magnets and magnet sets of this sort is patently unnecessary, and will do far more damage to the world by diminishing the opportunities for generating interest in science and physics, than any harm it might theoretically prevent.

I feel the current situation involving zoo?s, circus?s, game  farms etc. are just not working.  Elephants in captivity rarely receive the 5 things they need most to survive let  alone thrive.  Elephants need space, they need a variety of foods (grasses, hay,  vegetables, fruit) they need water and fresh air and most importantly they need a  variety of substrates to walk, stand and sleep on.  Zoo?s for the most part are built on and of concrete.  Concrete is not a forgiving  substance.  Endless standing around and laying down with little room to move  about freely or to get relief creates pressure soars and eventually leads to the  breakdown of the bones and joints in the legs and feet of the elephant.  Circus?s  again by their very nature of traveling and having to house the elephants in  confined spaces for extended periods of time enforce this condition of restricted  mobility.  Although zoo?s and circus?s etc. have access to veterinary services the life span of  the elephant has decreased significantly rather than increased.  You would think  with the elimination of natural predators and risks that the life span of the elephant  should increase significantly.  This has not been the case.  More and more  elephants are dying from arthritis, bone disease etc.  It doesn?t take a genius to figure out that zoo?s and circus?s can not provide  adequately for the elephant.  Most zoo?s don?t have the space or the ability to  expand ADEQUATELY.  A number of zoo?s do not have the funds to look after 3  elephants ? the absolute minimum that should be kept together.  Zoo?s and  Circus?s can not provide what is required to enable the elephant to live out their  nature lives, they can not provide a stress free environment to allow elephants to  NATURALLY breed.  They have lost the ability to help save the elephant and are  fast becoming a major threat to the health and welfare of the elephant.  There are several sanctuaries in the United States that seem to have developed an  ability to properly look after the elephants.  They seem to have a fundamentally  different philosophy from zoo?s and circus?s.  Sanctuaries put the welfare of the  animal first and foremost.  Zoo?s and circus?s put profit and politics first and  foremost and the animals lastly.', 'Progressive zoos and elephant experts are realizing that elephants do not adapt in captivity. They are dieing very prematurely and have immense physical and psychological maladies.  In captivity, elephants statistically develop <b>unnatural</b> health problems such as arthritis, foot and joint problems, reproductive problems, and psychological problems that are especially seen in an elephant in our Tucson zoo ? an unnatural, stereotypic swaying, as well as head bobbing and pacing that results from severe confinement and stress.  Asian elephant Connie swings her head back and forth non-stop, all day at the Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, AZ.  The zoo tries to put the public?s conscience at ease by lying and saying she does this because she is ?happy?, turning their backs to the fact that such behavior is well documented as a sign of stress and boredom.    <Br><br>In the wild, elephants walk up to 50 miles daily foraging for food.  While zoos and circuses provide food for elephants, so that aspect of walking is not necessary, the walking serves another purpose -  the prevention of the aforementioned arthritis and foot and joint problems.  Elephants in the wild do not have these issues like zoo and circus elephants, and the missing factor from these unnatural, typically concrete-floored environments is walking.  Also considering the great expanses elephants need to walk for their health, zoos, and circuses especially, cannot provide for these creatures.  The largest elephant enclosure in the US is eight acres, which is still horribly small for the world?s largest land mammal.  <br><br>Elephants are intelligent, social animals, which prefer to live in herds of at least a half-dozen.   It was elephants\' complex social patterns, in fact, that prompted the Bronx Zoo\'s decision not to replace its three female elephants when they die.  Elephants show humor and express compassion for one another with intense interactions. The reality of their lives in captivity is that many are in chains up to 18 hours a day, mainly referring to circuses. They are enclosed in steel pens, many times alone, broken and controlled by fear and intimidation.  Trainers often use bull hooks and electrical prods, and such inhumane training has even been well documented via first-hand accounts and undercover footage.  Tim Frisco, a trainer at a circus named Carson and Barnes, has been shown telling would-be trainers how to dominate elephants and make them perform circus tricks, saying, <br><i>?Sink that hook into ?em. When you hear that screaming, then you know you got their attention.?</i><Br><br>The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) does not prohibit the use of this type of cruelty and the following of this law is loosely monitored.  Many cities in the US already have banned circuses and rodeos, or the use of chemical, manual or electrical means to force an animal to perform, and internationally, multiple cities in 12 large countries have banned animal acts for entertainment all together.  It is recognized that abuse in the animal entertainment circuit is common and widespread, and such places have taken a stand to not support such behavior.  But it really should be banned altogether, at least on a national level.  <br><br>Leaders of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association depict critics of elephants in captivity as a small minority of animal-rights ""extremists.""  This is not accurate at all.  This subject has been focused on by mainstream channels like <i>CNN, PBS</i>, and <i>Discovery</i>, on shows like <i>20/20</i>, and even <i>National Geographic</i> magazine has covered this debate.    <Br><Br>Even my grandmother and her friends, all conservative Christians, get very upset about this issue and were crushed when Tucson?s City Council voted to keep our elephants here instead of sending them to <I>The Elephant Sanctuary</i> in Hohenwald, TN.  Despite public outcry in countless letters to our area?s papers asking to send the elephants to a sanctuary, it was largely evident that there were many other factors at work here ? one of the council members and the city manager were both closely working with the zoo through the whole fight, and our zoo used tactics like bringing uninformed and manipulated children of zoo employees to Tucson City Council meetings to speak about keeping the elephants here.  Something must be done on a greater scale to help elephants in zoos and circuses because this is a difficult fight from a grassroots level ? the American Zoo and Aquarium Association has mastered tactics, which they teach to zoos, to defeat citizens against them.  <br><br>It should also be noted that the American Zoo and Aquarium Association?s standards for elephants are completely absurd ? they require a minimum only 1,800 square feet of outdoor living space.  Plus, their survival depends on the revenue of zoos and circuses, so to say they are bias and not truly fighting for the welfare of these animals is an understatement.  Often, they tote the argument that zoos are working for conservation.  In no way do zoos aid in developing a conversation ethic; millions more are spent on keeping these animals pent up in miniscule habitats instead of being given to the actual conservation effort. With elephants, we are currently destroying their habitat faster then ever before, and Asian elephants are even endangered.  Also, captive breeding of elephants had been grossly unsuccessful.  Conservation is carried out by habitat protection and anti-poaching measures.  If these two things are not focused on and given the immense funding they lack, elephants will not survive regardless of how many we put on display for the public?s enjoyment.    <br><br>People directly connected to or deliberately mislead by the zoo and circus business continually fight the logical and compassionate masses, reputable scientists, and progressive people in the Zoo and animal-care industry.  For instance, Ron Kagan, the director of the Detroit Zoo, last year gave up two of his elephants out of concern for their welfare.  Kagan sent them to a sanctuary near Sacramento, CA.  ""<i>By many indices, elephants just don\'t do very well in captivity,</i>"" Kagan told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In addition to the Detroit Zoo, at least eight other American Zoo and Aquarium Association accredited zoos have recognized that they cannot adequately provide for the needs of elephants and have closed their exhibits, sending their elephants one of the two American elephant sanctuaries.  <br><br>Close to my home is another ""extremist"", David Hancocks, former director of the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, a very ethical and natural zoo in the heart of Tucson\'s Saguaro National Monument.  Hancocks wrote in a Seattle Times commentary last year that <i>""the history of elephants in zoos is full of mental and physical pain."" </i>  <br><Br>Then there is The Humane Society of the United States. ""<I>We don\'t think that elephants can be kept humanely in zoos</i>,"" Richard Farinato, a Humane Society executive, bluntly told a Portland, Oregon weekly newspaper.  Even the USDA, in a 1998 elephant course document, has said, <i>?The absence of walking ... must have dramatic long-term effect on the elephants\' physical and mental stability and must ultimately affect its longevity and propagation.?</i>  <br><br>I understand that people enjoy taking their children to the zoo, but <b>children are so very compassionate by nature</b> when given the reality of a situation.  <B>They do not want elephants to suffer at their expense</b>.', 'Please create legislation which will put an end to the misery and life long suffering  of any animal, but in particular elephants....I beg you.  Thank you.', 'I support all efforts to dramatically improve conditions for captive elephants in this  country. As of right now, zoos and circuses are not giving elephants the conditions  they require for their health and well-being such as adequate space and natural  environment for them to thrive. In too many zoos and circuses they suffer from lack  of space, unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause a range  of preventable ailments -- from painful arthritis and foot disease to reproductive and  digestive disorders to neurotic behaviors like swaying and head bobbing.  Many zoos lock their elephants in barn stalls for at least 12 hours a day when the  zoo is closed. And, in northern zoos, elephants are confined indoors for extended  periods during the cold winter months. Additionally, circuses and many zoos  control their elephants through force, domination and aggressive use of the bull  hook and prolonged chaining.   Exhibitors of elephants must be required to provide large, naturalistic environments  similar to those at The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the PAWS  sanctuary in California. These two refuges provide hundreds to thousands of acres  over which elephants can roam, socialize and maintain their health.

These two refuges provide hundreds to thousands of acres over which elephants  can roam, socialize, and have a chance to have good physical and mental health.  These refuges are examples to be copied of responsible, humane care of  elephants.   Circuses, by their very definition, cannot house or keep elephants humanely and  the use of elephants in circuses should now be prohibited just as bear-baiting and  other barbaric practices were a century ago.   Furthermore, the use of bullhooks, chains, electric shock devices, and other  instruments of force against elephants must be prohibited in zoos. When  elephants lack sufficient space, are forced to live under unnatural conditions, and  suffer from social deprivation, they become neurotic and succumb to physical  ailments such as arthritis, foot diseases, pneumonia, tuberculosis, reproductive  and digestive. When elephants lash out at circus ""trainers"" it should be seen for  what it is: a highly intelligent, emotionally and culturally (socially) complex  suffering animal that is rebelling against human exploiters. It is not safe for  humans to be around mistreated elephants.   It has come to my attention that zoos often lock elephants in barn stalls for at  least 12 hours a day when the zoo is closed. Moreover, in northern climes,  elephants are confined indoors for extended periods during the cold winter months.  This is not humane.   In summary, circuses and most zoos are not following the law according to the  Animal Welfare Act. In order to be allowed to keep captive elephants responsibly  and humanely, zoos must be made to follow much higher standards of care than  they do at present. There can be no quesiton that elephants suffer in small,  unchallenging zoo environments. In all good conscience zoos must recognize this  scientific fact and provide much more for these wondrous creatures to receive the  care they deserve and we owe them. Circuses must be prohibited from keeping  elephants altogether. It is simply not possible for a circus to keep an elephant  humanely.', 'Zoos and circuses do not provide elephants with the conditions they require for  their health and well-being.

An estimated half of all captive elephants suffer from arthritis and foot disease,  and these ailments are the leading cause of euthanasia in captive elephants.  Circus elephants are often subjected to prolonged chaining, spending up to 21  hours a day standing in chains and more than 11 months of the year traveling in  train boxcars, where they are again chained, and forced to endure extreme  temperatures and to stand for hours in their own waste. Many zoo elephants are  also subjected to prolonged chaining, and to confinement in barn stalls for  extended periods of time.

Your recognition of these institutes as providing outstanding treatment, care and maintenance of healthy habitats is greatly appreciated.  Thank you!  I spent a week at Dolphin Research Center as part of their Dolphin Lab program.  There I got a closer look and better education of a marine mammal facility.  During my time at DRC I participated in multiple in-water dolphin interactions, signal exercises, observation time, followed trainers on boardwalks, and watched other programs and training sessions.   During these times I had opportunities to watch trainers working with more than one dolphin at a time.  I was impressed with both the dolphins' interactions with the trainer and each other  and also with how the trainer interacted with multiple dolphins during this time.  There was no confusion and the animals seemed to enjoy themselves.  Being a dog trainer myself, I know the benefits and difficulties of a trainer working with more than one animal at a time. There are many enrichments and learning opportunities that the individual animals receive during sessions where multiple animals are involved. Please allow one trainer to work with multiple dolphins at the same time.  I would also like to make a comment on your proposal that the dolphins remain visible to the trainer during interactions.  This would not be beneficial to some facilities, such as Dolphin Research Center, which are located in the dolphin's natural habitat. During my visit to DRC, I observed that although at times the water was not easy to see very far through, it never appeared to cause problems.  The trainers still seemed to know just about where the dolphins would surface when they were asked for a behavior. And for the most part, the dolphins remained visible on or near that surface during guest interactions, such as for dorsal tows or imitations.

IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species  to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'I have worked in the marine mammal care field for 4 years and have enjoyed educating and inspiring guests during our interactive programs with common bottlenose dolphins.

The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Please revise and update your proposals and standards to reflect current scientific understanding of marine animals, and the care and treatment they deserve!  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals.

The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  The agency has decided not to change the space requirements for the several marine mammal species covered by the regulations, even though those space requirements were originally established over 30 years ago. In 1984, the last time the space standards were updated, the science on marine mammal movements in the wild was not very advanced. Within the past 15 years, however, technology has emerged that allows scientists unprecedented access to the world below the waves inhabited by marine mammalsand an outpouring of studies has ensued. Yet, APHIS stated in its proposed rule that it was unaware of any science supporting changes in the space requirements. That APHIS could imply that such science is lacking (or claim to be unaware of it) strains credulity.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes.

In addition, hospital emergency rooms and doctors offices treat hundreds of thousands of trampoline-related injuries each year. Both trampolines and skateboards are marketed to and intended for use by children.   And the argument that there is no way to know if any in the set are missing is patently false. There are many structures that can be quickly assembled that require all the magnets to be present, for example a set of 216 can make a 6-sided cube, one large, flat hexagon, or twelve 2-layer hexagons.

When I was 12, I fell on the sidewalk from rollerblades that required surgery in my hand.  I have had stitches several times from falling off my bicycle.  I have had multiple shoulder surgery's from basketball injuries.  Aside from proving my being very prone to injury, I hope it illustrates that all toys can be dangerous.  We can't just regulate everything away in the name of safety.  Parents need to have some responsibility with their children, and realize that some toys (such as these magnets) are not for young children that would put them in their mouth.  And even for older children, should be used with adult supervision.   If giant labels on the product are required to help people realize that they can be hazardous, then that is fine.  But banning a product in its entirety seems a little overkill.  I am surprised products like magnets are being considered to be banned when other products on the market are sold that are known to cause cancer and other life threatening injuries (cigarettes, tanning beds/salons, etc).

The Federal Government needs to make certain that they have  decent living conditions, are not treatly inhumanely and are allowed socialization  with other elephans. Zoos and circuses do not provide elephants with the conditions they require for  their health and well-being.  The Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide elephants with  adequate space. Neither zoos nor circuses currently meet this requirement.  In too many zoos and circuses, elephants suffer not only from lack of space, but  from unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause a range of  preventable ailments ? including painful arthritis, foot disease, reproductive and  digestive disorders, and neurotic behaviors such as swaying and head bobbing.  An estimated half of all captive elephants suffer from arthritis and foot disease,  and these ailments are the leading cause of euthanasia in captive elephants.  Circus elephants are often subjected to prolonged chaining, spending up to 21  hours a day standing in chains and more than 11 months of the year traveling in  train boxcars, where they are again chained, and forced to endure extreme  temperatures and to stand for hours in their own waste. Many zoo elephants are  also subjected to prolonged chaining, and to confinement in barn stalls for  extended periods of time.  Circuses and many zoos control their elephants through force, domination, and  aggressive use of the bullhook and other tools of intimidation such as whips,  clubs, and electric shock devices.

I can only wonder what people from India think when they  come here and see how Americans treat these ""gentle giants"".  How do you think  this makes us look in the eyes of the rest of the world?', ""I have worked as an elephant keeper for the last 12 years at the Oakland Zoo in  Oakland, California.  I only say that as a point of reference and wish to add that  the views are mine and may or may not totally agree with the Zoo's offical position  on these issues.  We maintain 1.3 African elelphants in a protected contact  environment.  Arthritis has been documented as a relatively common issue with captive  elephants.  I believe several factors contribute to this problem.  Among these are  the substrates the elephants are exposed to, the weight of the animal, general  inactivity and prolonged chaining.  Like many of those who have previously responded I agree that hard surfaces  such as concrete, asphalt and hard packed soils put undue pressure on legs and  joints.  We have attempted to mitigate this somewhat by the use of rubber mats in  the indoor holding areas.  Outside holding areas that provide only hard packed  surfaces to little to alleviate this issue.  Ideally a substrate that provides some  cushion and which allows for necessary sanitary considerations would be best.  Captive elephants tend to be heavier than those in the wild.  Increased activity  levels and somewhat inconsistent diet due to climatic and seasonal changes work  to keep elephant weights lower than in captivity.  Excess weight puts additional  stress on joint/cartilage and increases wear rates.  General inactivity with captive  elephants adversely affects their ability to maintain healthy weights.  Chaining as  a management tool only adds to the problem.  Chains can and do provide a useful  tool in very specific situations but should be restricted to necessary health issues.  Proper foot care is a very subjective issue.  At a minimum each elephant's foot  needs to be cleaned and examined daily.  Some elephants need only minor  trimming and others require a more agressive approach.  Perhaps the best  approach would include more frequent inspections by knowledgeable experts to  ensure proper care is being maintained.  Various field experts report walking distances of 7 to 13 miles a day for free  roaming eleplhants. (Moss, 1988,  Sukumar, 2003)  We recently tripled the  outside holding area of our facility and attempt to maintain a minimum walking  distance of 3 miles per day.  Accredited zoos are required to meet the American Zoological and Aquarium  Association (AZA) standards for health care.  These are minimum standards and  do not necessarily provide the highest quality care.  For example, AZA standards  call for a minimum of 1800 sq ft for one elephant and 900 sq ft for each additional  elephant for outside holding area.  By this standard 41 elephants could be kept on  an american football field.  Common sense shows this is not acceptable.  I  endorse the standards as set forth in The Best Practices by the Coalition for  Captive Elephant Well-Being, 2005 (Kane, Forthman and Hancocks).  Wherever possible, I believe we should use nature to assist us in our decisions on  how best to care for captive elephants.  Unlike others who have responded I  strongly disagree that elephants should only be chained and housed indoor at  nights.  If facility design requires overnight chaining and no ability to single stall  animals then it is time for that facility to get out of the elephant business.  In conclusion, I would agree with the argument bigger is not necessarily better.   However, I will add that our elephants use all of the space provided.  In the two  years they have had access to the larger area they have all showed weight loss,  improved muscle tone and healthier feet.  Large does not mean better in and of  itself but it provides options that smaller spaces can not."", ""I strongly urge you to protect the physical and emotional health of elephants.

Something must be done to ensure that elephants have a good quality of life.  Currently elephants live a imprisoned existence:  -Chained up to 21 hours a day in one spot -traveling in a trailer with circuses nearly 365 days a year  -lack of  adequate space for normal every day walking  All of the above leading to devastating health issues as painful arthritis, digestive  disorders, neurotic behaviors to name a few.

Elephants need to move freely and need to be on surfaces other  than concrete.  So many captive animals suffer from arthritis or foot disorders  which are extremely painful.  Circus elephants, like their zoo cousins, are  subjected to domination through force--we have all seen the bull hook in action.   My family and I support all efforts to dramatically improve conditions for elephants,  especially by eliminating elephants from zoo and circus settings by sending them  to elephant sanctuaries, in California and Tennessee.  There, they would have  hundreds of acres to roam over gentle terrain, as they would in nature.  There they  could enjoy good health and security.

Give them sanctuary.  Thank  you.', ""I am writing because of my concern for the conditions that elephants are kept in zoos and  circuses. Research shows that elephants are extremely intelligent, social creatures. In many circuses  they are kept in chains and work constantly and are treated with force and controlled with pain.  In many zoos they are kept isolated and in very small enclosures which cause physical and  mental problems. To me it is a moral issue to treat all creatures humanely and with respect. This  is especially true for beings with emotions, intelligence and social interaction, which is the case  for elephants.  I have been to Africa three times and have had the privilege of seeing elephants in their natural  surroundings. They definitely had a complex interaction between herd members and were always  aware of where the humans were and what they were doing. Of all the animals I saw, including  lions, elephants were the most aware of human actions. I don't  even want to imagine what they  would go through if kept captive.  Please use your  authority to ensure that these magnificent creatures are kept in situations of  dignity and which allow them to thrive. Thank you."", 'If we confine a wild animal, we have a responsibility to maintain its physical and  psychological health by replicating the natural conditions in which it can thrive.   This includes normal range of activity, and social settings such as family groups,  herds, or packs.  Elephants in the wild spend their entire lives in family groups.  Because of their  massive size they must walk 30-40 miles on soft earth each day to avoid damage  to bones, joints, and feet.  Isolating elephants in small concrete or hardpack  enclosures condemns them to constant physical and emotional pain.  The USDA   must halt this practice at once.  Americans do not consent to inflicting a lifetime of  misery on helpless animals for entertainment.  With each passing year, zoos have more alternatives to the historic exhibition of  captive wild animals.  Children to not want to see, nor do they learn anything of  value from seeing, a solitary animal in pain and misery.  Robotics, holograms,  projections, ele-cams -- dozens of imaginative and playful technologies can teach  about elephants without sacrificing a single beast.   I urge the USDA and APHIS to confiscate all elephants confined in spaces less  than 10,000 acres per capita, and in groups of fewer than three adult females, and  to order them released to sanctuaries.  To understand the urgency of this request, please consider being locked in your  car for the rest of your life.  Thank you for your consideration.  Phyllis Elliott', 'Elephants are large animals and as such require appropriate accomodations. Zoos and circuses must be accountable to the Animal Welfare Act when taking on stewardship over these animals. Elephants need plenty of space and natural conditions to include socialization with other elephants. Elephants are often left chained for over 20 hours each day in enclosures and box cars enduring extreme temperatures and standing in their own waste, thus leading to preventable painful diseases that are the leading cause of euthenasia in captive elephants. Furthermore, the use of force and intimidation through bullhooks, whips, clubs and electric shock devices for managing these elephants is unnecessary and inexcusable. It is outright abuse to use any animal for exhibition while depriving it of conditions necessary to its health and well being. There are existing places already providing excellent models for humane elephant captivity: The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and The Performing Animal Welfare Society sanctuary in California. There is every reason to expect this standard for all captive elephants. It is a matter of responsible stewardship.', 'As an animal lover I wish all animals would get fair treatment from everyone. As a  human being worried about our childrens future I ask the people to set an example  to the young children that all living things must be shown respect. Knowing that  children see that it is ok to have Elephants in habitats that are FAR from their wild- life settings will only lead the them to believe that they can be around for our  entertainment.', 'Elephants are highly complex, social animals who have very close family  connections in the wild.  However, zoos and circuses often sever these ties  without a thought to the elephant\'s wishes as they move elephants around, and  this causes extreme anguish.    Elephants in zoos are given inadequate space, because in the wild elephants will  roam 20 or more miles each day.  In addition, the concrete floors on which they  are forced to stand produce painful leg and foot problems such as arthritis.  The  confinement will also produce neurotic behaviors such as pacing or self-harm.   Reproductive system shutdown and high infant mortality rate are also common  problems. The AZA, a zoo industry trade organization, provides an inadequate set  of standards for the care of elephants. These standards include a minimum  outdoor enclosure size of 1,800 square feet for one elephant, the equivalent of six  parking lot spaces. The standards also allow the prolonged chaining of elephants.  Elephants are genetically designed to move and forage constantly during the day;  zoos do not even come close to providing the resources necessary for this sort of  behavior.    Circuses also provide cruel living conditions for elephants.  In addition the the  cramped quarters similar to the zoos, elephants must endure agony at the hands  of their trainers and handlers.  Ringling\'s head elephant trainer Troy Metzler was  recently observed on two occasions sinking his hook into an elephant\'s trunk and  yanking the hook toward him with great force, likely tearing the elephant\'s  sensitive skin.  In addition, he forced elephants to travel, perform, and endure  terrible conditions even when sick or painfully injured.    Animals used in circuses are subjected to violent training, continual confinement,  and grueling routines. Whips, bullhooks, and chains are used to punish and  control animals. Many people are beginning to reject the notion that a fleeting  moment of fun is worth the agony that these magnificent animals must endure  daily.   Ringling Bros. has a lengthy history of animal abuse and neglect. Currently, the  USDA has four open investigations into Ringling for the deaths of a lion and an  elephant, for a December 2005 incident in which two elephants ran amok inside  an arena in Puerto Rico, and for a videotaped incident last August described by an  elephant expert as ""clear abuse"" in which a handler hit and jabbed a 7-year-old  elephant with a bullhook.  Ringling is a for-profit corporation that constantly puts  business interests ahead of animal welfare.  Please improve the situations of these magnificent creatures, and allow the the  respect they deserve.', 'Given what we know of the social nature of elephants, it is a clear act of cruelty to  deprive captive elephants of the space and social interaction that they need for  health and well-being.

Many zoos lock their elephants in barn stalls for at least 12 hours a day when  the zoo is closed. And, in northern zoos, elephants are confined indoors for  extended periods during the cold winter months.   5. Additionally, circuses and many zoos control their elephants through force,  domination and aggressive use of the bull hook and prolonged chaining. These  methods cause constant stress as well as physical and psychological injury to  elephants.   6.

With elephants chained down for long periods of time, boxed up in train cars for even longer periods of time, and forced to perform on stage, there is nothing justifiable.  Often, such conditions lead to sickness -- psychological and/or physical -- in the elephants.  Using bullhooks and other sharp instruments, elephant trainers use fear and aggression to train these gentle a","chnology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'i have been a member of dolphin research center for over 25 years!on my numerous visits i believe them to be the best  place for caring for  dolphins as well as other mammals etc.. they do studies and educate guests when coming there to visit..it is a wonderful place to see how much they care for all marine mammals.it is by far the best place for those dolphins that live there.i went there myself on a visit as i said over 25 yrs ago and was so impressed i joined!the dolphins do what they want, when they want ,and arent stressed to  do shows and perform as in theme parks!

I believe that every creature would be less and less cared about. Almost every trainer I have met started wanting this career at a very young age, and usually because of their first trip to Sea World. Without that experience, where would we be? I love my job and I love caring for these amazing animals and educating the public how they can make a change.

I've been a long standing specialist of Dolphin Quest dating back to the period of time when the National Marine Fisheries conducted their initial studies on Swim with the Dolphin programs.  I have served on the board of the International Marine Animal Trainers' Association (IMATA) and continue to be an active member of the trainer community.  Currently, I serve on the board for the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) as Director at Large.  From these collective experiences, I have committed my full professional career to advancing the science and wellness of marine mammals, promoting conservation through guest interactions, collaborating with like-minded scientists and marine mammal activists and fostering learning and development for our next generation of marine mammal advocates.      It's from this vantage point that I am able to recognize the importance of weighing in on these very important regulatory measures.  Thank you for providing the platform to do so.  Dolphin Quest is proud to meet and exceed the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) standards regarding dolphins under human care.  We pride ourselves on leading by example and value collaborating with those in our community who, like us, dedicate their lives to the animals under our care.  Our relationships with our animals run deep, often times, garnering our time and dedication to the same level or more that we provide our family members.  Through these long standing and cherished relationships comes a secure experiential understanding of the needs of our dolphins and the rich lifestyles they lead.  Their days, filled with social enrichment, learning challenges and large natural stimulating environments, are robust of mental and physical stimulation.  They flourish with species typical opportunities to play with each other in their ocean home while benefiting from an added advantage of the human animal bond.  This is the ultimate sanctuary for any animal.  From our long standing bonds come the privilege and responsibility of ensuring our animals' wellness is a top priority.  This is where government regulations come into play.    For close to three decades, Dolphin Quest has successfully conducted interactive programming with our family of dolphins and the guests who choose to join us in our ocean conservation campaign.  These programs have fallen under the current AWA standards and have a strong historical record of accomplishment, all with the animals' best interests at heart.  I feel that the general standards and guidelines have demonstrated an efficacy indicating no need to further regulate any type of interactive programming.  Our depth and breadth of experience handling our collective groups of animals only continues to flourish over time.  Attempting to blanket regulations over a large variety of marine mammal species and programming types will only limit our ability to continue expanding our learning horizons and animal management practices.  Our performance based standards speak for themselves as a community and should be enough to validate the current regulatory oversight we follow.    Our time is best spent nurturing our animal relationships, connecting and sharing with our guests and supporting new scientific understanding of the species in our care.  To have to divide our time managing additional regulations and standards that don't further the goals of the AWA seems to be an unreasonable request considering our history.  At the same time, APHIS will be burdened with follow through on reports and more intrusive inspections without furthering a meaningful goal.    Please default to your well stated recognition of the success and safety of interactive programming and focus on updating and fine tuning general standards and guidelines for regulating marine mammals under human care.  To date, it's been an effective way to ensure the AWA goals are met and the animals within the care of these organizations adhering to them are thriving.    Thank you for your time and consideration.

I look forward to have the opportunity to visit SeaWorld and other marine mammal parks for years to come.  I am a trainer at SeaWorld. Not only do I get to facilitate ""the light bulb"" go off for kids and adults but things I train the animals I care for could save lives.   My father was my biggest supporter in reaching my dreams of training killer whales.  He passed away before he was able to see me reach those dreams. Today the animals I work with are participating in a study that I helped train them to do.  Not only do they love participating in the study but it will someday hopefully be able to save someone like my father. Please make sure that places like SeaWorld will be here for my children. They foster a love for our earth and all of the animals in it. Through training and working with these animals it supports a safe and fun life for the animals who make SeaWorld a home. They also contribute in an enormous way to animals all over this world, including humans.', ""The proposed modifications to the ventilation and lighting requirements seem reasonable in thatbased on the background information providedthey are beneficial to the animals and not very onerous on most facilities. The proposed rule's requirement that the ventilation maintain relative humidity at a level that prevents condensation in order to minimize the potential for bacterial, fungal, or viral contamination from condensation is one such example. The specific modification is expected to reduce risks of skin and mucous membrane irritation and bacterial and mold growth without imposition of any substantial costs.  Similarly, the proposed rule's specific lighting requirements also seem to be favorable to the animals. As indicated by the background information, the specific requirements would ensure normal functioning of metabolic systems for animals and provide facility personnel sufficient light to observe animals and to operate safely. Moreover, this can be done through the imposition of small, if any, expected costs due to the fact that most facilities are already in compliance. Also, the proposed requirement that shade must be accessible and must cover sufficient area to afford all the animals within the enclosure protection from direct sunlight seems very reasonable as it protects the animals from overheating, sunburns, and eye-damage."", 'To Whom It May Concern: \t \tThe proposed rule issued by the the Animal and Planet Health Inspection Service (APHIS) would greatly increase the health and well being of marine mammals in captivity. Captive marine mammals encounter more stress than their counterparts that remain in the wild. Implementing the proposed rules would provide a more comfortable living environment for all species involved. The revisions of the indoor facilities, outdoor facilities, space requirements, water quality, and the swim-with-dolphin programs would promote better living environments, and in-turn could potentially facilitate longer captive life spans, better breeding conditions, and overall a better quality of life. Studies have shown that captive marine mammals have a shorter lifespan vs. marine mammals in a natural habit.  In conclusion, I fully support the proposed rule that APHIS has implemented. I believe it will provide a better overall living condition for the marine mammals in captivity, and will increase their lifespans.', 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Please do not look at the numbers of people who visit those prisons but look at the numbers of people who do NOT visit those prisons. Investigate how many people are shocked and will never go back. If you choose for not making those prisons bigger then at least reduce the numbers of animals by not permitting the the facilities to take in more. For each rescued mammal they should mandatory give up and send back a healthy one to his or her natural habitat.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'According to these records, a proposed rule in the Federal Register was published on February 23, 1999. 13 sections were resolved but four were not. Those four are to be dealt with now. With the last of the resolutions in 2001, it has been 15 years that these four sections have sat still and those years that marine animals have suffered. It doesn\'t take a scientist to tell you that all animals deserve to be treated in the best facilities and with the highest quality of regards. I believe we should address these last four sections as well as re-address the other 13, as science has been making strides and animals should reap the benefits as humans do. This proposed rule also states a handful of new lingo for around and in pertinence to the term ""swim-with-the-dolphins"" and all with the highest regard to keeping every party involved safe. All actions in this ruling ensue protective and safe courters for all creatures involved. I support this proposed rule.', ""My love of Dolphins grew expediently after having an in depth interaction course.  My son has learned about sea creatures by interacting with them at Sea World.

Given the fact that these animals are being kept captive and in most cases used for entertainment and human benefit, I think that they deserve to at least live in the best conditions possible. I think it\'s very important to keep in mind that the world is constantly changing and especially that new technologies are continuously being established. This means that we will continue to make new scientific discoveries and must realize that different methods can be improved, as is the case with the water temperature, ventilation, and lighting that captive animals would require in order to simulate their natural habitats as best as possible. And even congress members, Jared Huffman and Adam Schiff, issued a statement urging that the Animal Welfare Act be updated since ""sound, modern science should inform our regulations on marine mammal captivity."" And with the over 300 public comments submitted, this is clearly an important topic, where many people consider these updates overdue.  I also find it deeply unsettling that the regulations on the swim with the dolphin (SWTD) programs were suspended in 1999, especially considering the boom in the demand for these interactions. There should definitely be some sort of amendment made to this act that more clearly covers the requirements and regulations to carry out these SWTD programs and more enforcement to make sure that these animals aren\'t being mistreated. These programs are already quite risky considering that ""captive dolphins may exhibit an assimilation tendency, expecting humans to fulfill the naturals roles of their wild counterparts."" They could potentially become more sexually aggressive and agitated due to the ""stressful conditions of forced interaction."" These behaviors could result in not only harm to the animal, but also to humans. It is a definite necessity to implement more checks and controls on these interactions.

I am deeply concerned with the increasing frequency at which pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons are treating infants, children and adolescents for ingestion of high-powered magnets. Despite laudable efforts by the CPSC to educate the public about the dangers of high-powered magnet sets and improvements in manufactures warning labels, data collected by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) provide compelling evidence that warning labels are not working. Magnet ingestions and the injuries they cause to children are preventable, and the most effective way to prevent ingestions is to ban the sale of high-powered magnet sets, as defined in the proposed rule.    Children sometimes swallow things they shouldnt, but these magnets pose special risk to children. Coins, marbles, and even thumbtacks often pass without incident. In contrast, when these high-powered magnets are swallowed, endoscopic or surgical intervention is required in nearly all cases to prevent bowel damage.   Magnet ingestions by children are no longer a rare occurrence. Manufacturers claim there have been few injuries from ingestion of magnets sold as part of their magnet desk toys. The experiences of pediatric gastroenterologists across the country who are treating children who have ingested high-powered magnets suggest otherwise.    The proposed rule accurately describes the injuries, which can be very serious and even life threatening, that result from ingestion of magnets from high-powered magnet sets. The vast majority of magnet ingestions require endoscopic or surgical intervention.', 'The idea of banning these is mind numbing. People need to take responsibility for their own stupidity.  Do not do it.', ""I am opposed to this ban.  Do you plan do ban all items marketed to adults that are dangerous to children?  Of course not, it is well understood that there are a wide variety of items, including 'toys' that are not appropriate and/or safe for children.  This ban is overstepping your power, or even congress' power.  It would be understandable to require warnings and ensure that marketing was directed towards adults, for example following the precedent of restrictions on advertising alcohol, but an outright ban on a product that is useful, creative, and benign is ridiculous and undermines legitimate authority of the CPSC."", ""Why?

Mechanical Safety Mechanisms like the one proposed by the CSPA are much better. It also bears noting that theyre not proposing to eliminate a literacy aid or a cultural fetish.

You wouldnt dream of allowing a child to play with matches, staplers, acid or mercury and thats exactly why those products dont require as much regulation. The dangers are evident and recognized. Not so with magnets and therefore the CSPA is correct in proposing a rule. Furthermore, by regulating the size and flux of magnets they are acknowledging that potential of manufacturers to produce the product in a manner that will significantly reduce the risks posed without closing off the potential for revenue from this technology.

The conditions in which  elephants are kept in zoos and circuses is inhumane.  Elephants need a much larger amount of space than is found in most zoos.

Elephants also need to live in large social groups.  In the wild, female elephants  stay together in large families.  This is important for their psychological health.  It  is exceedingly cruel to isolate an elephants, such as the lephants at the Alaska  zoo.  (It is also exceedingly cruel to have an elephant in a cold climate like  Alaska, where she needs to be kept indoors for most of the year.)  Zoos and circuses should not be allowed to beat their elephants or use bullhooks  on them.  Elephants are very sensitive to pain.  I am appalled that a zoo like El  Paso can get away with abusively beating its elephants  Circus trainers are even  more violent with elephants than zoos are.  Elephants are beaten enough to make  them be submissive enough to peform unnatural and uncomfortable acts.  Elephants are also currently kept in unhealthy conditions.  Many circus elephants  suffer from TB and do not receive adequate treatment.Elephants are chained or  confined to boxcars for long hours.  They do not receive an adequate diet.

We  need stronger regulations, however, to protect elephants in zoos and circuses  from those who exploit them with little regard for their suffering.  Please revise your regulations so that elephants have an adequate amount of  space and are able to live in large social groups.

APHIS has not only the opportunity to demonstrate its  leadership in supporting high ethical standards in the treatment of animals, but  also the obligation to protect those creatures who cannot speak for themselves.    I urge APHIS to place a higher priority on animal welfare than on business profits,  and adopt sensible policies that promote the well-being of animals rather than  defend inhumane practices by zoo and circus owners.

I know you must have received a  ton of comments about this, but they need a voice. Circuses and zoos are not  meeting the proper requirements for giving these beautiful and smart creatures  care. There are so many animals out there that need to be unleashed from the  chains that bound them. They were not born to be captive. They were born with  feelings and emotions. The excessive mistreatment and punishment they receive  is a crime and although there are so many things going on in the world, this too is  an outrage and cannot be overlooked.  Please help make sure that they are provided proper environments and sufficient  treatment to prevent neurotic behaviors, disease and death. Thank you for hearing  my voice and your consideration.', ""Re space and living conditions for captive elephants in the United States:  I have long been very concerned about the plight of captive elephants. Although the  Animal Welare Act requires that zoos and circuses provide elephants with  adequate space, the reality is that neither zoos nor circuss meet this requirement,  nor do zoos and circuses provide elephants with the conditions they require for  optimum health and wellbeing.   Because of this lack of oversight, elephants suffer from lack of space, social  deprivation and other unnatural conditions. Elephants suffer from painful arthritis,  foot disease, digestive disorders, and neurotic behaviors --all of which are  preventable.  It is tragic that half of all captive elephants suffer from arthritis and  foot disease and that these ailments are the leading cause of euthanasia in  captive elephants. Even worse is that elephants are much too often subjected to prolongued chaining-- up to 21 hours a day and in circuses, chained in traveling boxcars for 11 months of  the year.  They are forced to endure extreme temperatures and stand for hours in  their own waste.  I don't believe elephants belong in circuses under any  circumstances, but at the very least, if these people are going to make money off  of these animals, they should be forced to treat them humanely and properly. Bullhooks, whips, clubs and electric chock devies and all other tools of  intimidation should be outlawed.  If circuses treated theri animals properly there  would be no need to abuse them with these objects. Finally, exhibitors of elephants must be required to provide large, natural  environments similar to the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the Performing  Animal Welfare Society sanctuary in California.  These two refuges provide  hundreds to thousands of acres for elephants to roam, socialize and live  more  normal and natural lives.  If zoos cannot provide such habitat, then they have no  business exhibiting elephants.  And circuses should be prohibited from having any  elephants at all.   Thanks you for considering my views.  I hope you place as much weight on the  public's support for a better life for captive elephants as you are sure to do with  protests from industries that make money from exploiting elephants."", 'Elephants suffer greatly in zoos.They suffer foot and joint problems from standing  on hard surfaces for long periods of time.

Since new and updated scientific research has become available about different aspects of caring for theses animals, then I think the current regulations need to be trained. Marine mammals need to have adequate space to swim around and to be comfortable, they should not be in tight quarters. The information on water quality is another reason I agree with this proposed rule. We need to make sure that marine mammals are not swimming in water the is filled with pathogens that could harm them and the same goes for the overall water quality.

It is obvious the veterinarians, trainers and caretakers love the animals and the animals love them. The experience instills me and my friends and family with a deeper understanding and respectful appreciation of the natural world.   Thank you for your diligent commitment to animal welfare.

I love SeaWorld', ""Aloha,   My name is Cameron Dabney, Regional Education Supervisor for Dolphin Quest.   At Dolphin Quest, our mission is to touch hearts and minds through fun, innovative experiences that create a connection to nature and a passion to learn more.   Each and every day, we fulfill our mission.   We inspire thousands of people each year through our hand-on, interactive programs with our Common Bottlenose Dolphins. We support local schools by offering School Programs that are aligned with State and National Science Standards. We align ourselves with the world's most renown Marine Mammals Scientists, Behaviorists, and Veterinarians and are among the elite when it comes to neonatal care. Our innovative natural habitats are on the cutting edge of offering ocean-based sanctuaries for our animals. This has been so for almost 30 years.  As members of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, we are held to the highest level of animal care standards. We wholeheartedly understand what it takes to allow our animals to thrive under our care.   For this, we thank you for your diligent commitment to animal welfare.    As a scientist, active conservationist, and passionate animal lover, I recommend that any modifications to the APHIS regulations be based on the most current scientific studies and information from the aforementioned marine mammal specialists who have the necessary experience needed to fully understand the best care for these animals.   It is crucial that marine parks and aquariums continue to educate the public and increase our collective knowledge of these animals to better protect them in the wild. Many people, including myself, might never have the opportunity to see these amazing animals if it were not for facilities like Dolphin Quest. In fact, I pursued a career in Marine Biology after visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California as a child, where I got to see a Sea Otter up close. So I know from first hand experience what meeting an animal (that is illegal to touch or come close to in the wild) can do to spark an interest and even a career! For that, I work diligently each day to inspire the next generation of ocean stewards.  As a long time supporter of marine parks and aquariums, I have learned so much about the animals, the environment, and the importance of conservation.  They have inspired me to improve my personal actions in my daily life and in my support of the environment around me.  I hope that you will consider reaching out to facilities, like Dolphin Quest, for input on any changes in regulations regarding our animals.   Again, thank you for your thoughtful consideration on this important matter.   Sincerely,  Cameron Dabney Regional Education Supervisor Dolphin Quest  www.dolphinquest.com"", 'As a concerned citizen and consumer, I want to be sure that the regulations are not too numerous or onerous. They should be based on science and not emotion. And they should balance the best interests of both man and marine mammals. Educating people about these wonderful animals is the best way to preserve them and engender respect for them.', 'I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

Unfortunately we will never be able to perfect conditions for captive animals, but we always need to strive for improvement to make their lives as happy and healthy as possible when they do not have the option to leave. With the recent exposure of Sea World's history of poor captivity conditions for their orcas (and their denial of it) along with the recent upgrade of animal abuse to now being considered a Group A felony alongside homicides and arson, improvements in standards are more likely to be universally accepted and willing to be funded at this time.  Although I do find captivity for marine mammals to be more inhumane than land mammals, they are important because it saves the lives of animals that are from well-known poacher locations or are saved after abandonment (and a variety of other factors), and it gives the animals a chance at life that would have otherwise been taken from them.  Any improvement or request for upgrades is one step in the right direction, and when these changes are enforced it will provide more opportunity for even more improvements to be created."", 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  To not change the space requirements for marine mammals would be immoral and cruel. The best thing for them would be not to be held captive in the first place but since for now that is not the case the very least they deserve is to have ample space and depth for them to survive in. Studies aside although for the last 16 years there have been many to support this change all you have to do is look at the enclosures they are kept in. It\'s more than obvious that they are not kept in the size that they need to survive in. 30 years ago was the last time anything happened regarding this and that was years before scientific advancements in this resrarch. Science and studies adamantly support this change. Technology has came a long way in 30 years enabling studies that could have never been done at that time. The time has come to make those changes so that they at least have a proper living environment. Captivity is cruel enough but to not give them what they need is is inhumane immoral and ethically unacceptable. Thank you  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

The magnets are not intended for children, but the rule is being made on the basis of use by children.  I own these magnets and enjoy their use.  They serve valid scientific, entertainment, and artistic purposes.    There are many products on the market that cause vastly more injuries and deaths, but are not under attack.  There are products for adults, which cause millions of dollars of injuries each year, in medical treatment, yet the CPSC does not regulate them or require simple and effective additional safety improvements.  There are many products for children, which cause many deaths and injuries each year, but are not being regulated by the CPSC, and few of the objects that are regulated are facing a ban, and the bankrupting of multiple companies.    It makes no sense to regulate a product for adults, which has caused few if any injuries to adults or children, when more dangerous products are being ignored.  The pursuit of this misplaced regulation shows the agency to be capricious, unfair, and incompetent.    Many regulations and safety requirements are needed.  This one is not.  Put your attention where it is warranted by solid statistical evidence.  End this witch hunt.', 'In your summary, you state ""In contrast to ingesting other small parts, when a child ingests a magnet, the magnetic properties of the object can cause serious, life-threatening injuries.""  There are many products I can buy that will have fatal results if ingested. Most medicines. Rat poison. Household cleansers. Razor blades. Lightbulbs. These things are all deadlier than little magnets, none are marketed towards children, and they should all be kept out of reach of children. The difference is that you can still buy all the deadly products I\'ve listed above. Why are you singling out little magnets?', 'Requirements for these should be left to individuals, along with the responsibilities.  Government should not be wasting time on regulating magnets.', 'As a practicing pediatric gastroenterologist and a mother of a toddler, I understand firsthand the real danger of high energy magnets.  I have personally removed magnets from the stomach of a curious toddler who found the magnets stuck to his parents metallic garbage can.  His parents had read about the risk of these ""bucky balls"" and had thrown them out weeks before.  Unknowingly, a few balls had stuck to the can and were found and ingested by their son.  He was lucky that his only risk was the anesthesia required for an endoscopy as we were successful in removing the magnets.  My colleagues have cared for other less fortunate children who have required emergency surgery and removal of parts of their intestines for perforations (or holes) caused by the magnets.  This can be fatal and/or require lifelong impairment, which is particularly devastating as these children were completely healthy prior to ingestion.  While these bucky balls are advertised as an adult toy, I have seen them sold in museum book stores, gift shops, etc where children would easily have access.  In my own home, my 2 year old son\'s favorite toys are anything his parents use (even better if he is not supposed to have it).  I have babyproofed our home and supervise him at all times. But, I have witnessed how he explores new things with all senses including taste.  I also know how fast he has developed and how quickly he could ingest these magnets in our home even if kept in a ""safe"" place.  For the safety of my patients and my son, I strongly encourage the government to take a stand and support the ban of these high energy magnets from sale.', ""What's this I hear about magnets not being safe? What about the 100 - LB lift super magnets that you can buy from websites that offer the exact same magnets as Zen Magnets? Those are worse than these little spheres and if anyone is willing to swallow them, then they shouldn't be anywhere near children when they do it at the least. These 'TOYS' are great stress relievers and I have spent hours just modeling with my little set that I have. No small toys should be near any little person/s mouth at all and especially not when there is no adult supervision. Disabling websites from selling these will only only make people buy them from stores. I had a box of magnets and stick magnets from Wal-Mart and the magnets would break and come loose but Wal-Mart still sold them. Being over-cautious is only going to make U.S. and Canada afraid to do anything except eat and sleep. What's next, CD-ROMs are going to be banned because they are 'too sharp' around the edge? The only reason anyone ever gets complaints about anything is because it is being used wrong."", 'This Rule is an excessive response to a rather minimal risk. Less extreme forms of regulation should be more than adequate to ameliorate the risk associated with products of this type.  Moreover, products of this type also provide many benefits that often go unmentioned.  Magnets used for sculpting enhance creativity, reduce stress, promote understanding of the principles of magnetism, and can be used in a variety of ways, including educational scientific experiments.  Additionally, I have personally used them in my educational self-management practice to promote attention regulation and enhance executive functioning.  Do not rob responsible consumers of the right to benefit from access to this class of products.    \tBesides,this isn\'t so much a discussion about the dangers of magnets, but more the CPSC and Pediatric Gastroenterologist organizations trying to flex their power.  They\'ve organized their members to submit comments that continually repeat that ""people cannot be trusted to listen to warnings"", while never addressing the arguments against theirs. If the CPSC won\'t listen to the 85%+ public consensus against the ban, perhaps the CPSC should listen to Nancy Voice-of-Reason Nord, the CPSC\'s own most experienced commissioner, when she says:    The assumption that warnings don\'t work, undermine past safety standards deemed acceptable by the CPSC and US Congress.   The ban is overly broad. There are two distinct hazard patterns that should be addressed: Children under 5 tounging their environment, and teenagers mimicking piercings. And the ban includes products [like Zen Magnets] that have not demonstrated similar risks.   These magnets have much more utility, and lower instance of hazard than other products on the market.  If you truly believe that these products, as they are currently sold, do expose consumers to untenable levels of risk, then by all means add additional protections, but a ban is clearly excessive.', ""Listen, I know you guys are just trying to be helpful. You want to look out for people's safety and make sure that we aren't taken advantage and swindled. But here's the deal, these magnet companies don't want to hurt people and have gone to extraordinary methods to take care of people. We reasonable adults can take it from there and do the right thing. If some individuals can't handle the responsibility, there's no reason to take the joy from the rest of us. Already word has spread far and wide via the internet on potential dangers and at this point it's ridiculous that we are still trying to decide how to deal with some little metallic balls. Here's an idea: personal responsibility. Make those who are negligent and misuse the product liable, not those who make it as safe as possible and prominently publish warnings. You don't need to do this, because we can take care of it ourselves."", 'The ban on magnetic toys is arbitrary and ridiculous.  While it is upsetting that improper use of these magnets can cause injury, that is true of virtually every toy in existence.  Buckyballs are just commodity magnetic spheres which have been repackaged for consumers.  Thus the ban will be totally ineffective and easily bypassed by anybody with a computer.  Consumers can still go to one of many online magnet retailers and buy an identical product.  Are you going to go after these small businesses too?', 'Currently own several sets of ""Bucky balls"" and my 2 year old child has enjoyed playing with them for the past year, since he was one. Although he is always supervised, I\'ve never had any ""close calls"" that would have seemed to have injured him if un corrected. I think banning bucky balls is an over reaction.', ""The responsibility for the safety and well being of children is ultimately given to parents (not the government).  Rare earth magnets balls, are meant for adults and should be used as such.  Taking such objects away from responsible adults in an effort to curb bad parenting is reprehensible.   Dangers to children from objects in the home are not limited to just the magnets in question.  The following household items pose threats to children as well.  1) Electrical outlets- small children are naturally curious and tend to stick their fingers where they should not go.  Responsible parents provide adequate supervision or put covers over sockets to protect their children.  2) Compact fluorescent light bulbs - these bulbs contain mercury (dangerous) as well as pose a sharp object cutting and puncturing hazard.  Responsible parents keep them out of reach of children.  3) Kitchen knives - can seriously injure a child if he/she were to get one.  We keep them out of reach of children to keep them from hurting themselves.  4) Pillows/blankets - for newborns, these objects can lead to suffocation.  We rely on parents to ensure that these objects don't pose a hazard to their little one.   These examples are only a few of the myriad of hazards to children that exist in the home.  Ultimately children are going to hurt themselves in spite of all government regulations and even under the best parenting conditions.  It is our responsibility as parents to look after the children that are in our care and use objects, such as the magnets balls, in a manner that will not put children at risk.  There will always be bad parents that will allow harm to come to their children no matter what law/regulations are enacted, we see stories on the news all the time.  Adult consumers should be allowed the freedom to purchase any object they desire provided that the object is not illegal.  We should not restrict magnet ball sales.  They pose no greater threat than those already present in our homes."", ""I find it difficult to convey how ridiculous I find this proposal.  From an article I just read:  These rare earth magnet toys are inherently unsafe; there is no amount of warning or parental vigilance sufficient to prevent their misuse, writes another pediatric gastroenterologist, Bryan Rudolph.  Clearly, we also need to ban bleach, ammonia, butane lighters, firearms, etc.  Parental vigilance, apparently, is the job of policy makers.  There are reasons for government control, we should be protected from bad-faith products.  I don't want strychnine in my baby formula, for example.  But regulating toys?  I'm a very left-leaning liberal, and this is exactly what I imagine people become so exasperated about when describing a nanny state."", 'There\'s no need for a ban on magnet sets. These sets are meant as a sort of ""desk toy"" for adults, not for children. To contrast, there are many other ""dangerous"" things that are made specifically for children, and those are not banned. For instance, trampolines, bicycles, ripstiks, legos, etc. Yes, magnets are dangerous, but there\'s no need for a ban. The companies already post warnings. If parents aren\'t going to supervise their children, that\'s none of the government\'s concern.', ""I can see the concern but banning something should always be the last resort and its clear other steps available.  Please don't outright ban buckeyballs!"", 'This is a ridiculous waste of tax payer money.  Batteries are far more lethal to children than magnets and yet they get pass because they are not a ""toy""?  There are plenty of toys that use those batteries and not all of them have secure enclosures that cannot be opened without a tool (screwdriver).    Yes - those toys that have insecure battery disclosures are marked with age restrictions, however if that is all it takes, shouldn\'t the same logic and conventions apply for the magnets?', 'Please don\'t ban these magnets!

The second case was a 5 yo who had ingested 5 magnets, had multiple perforations, and has required extensive gastrointestinal sugeries.  From my limited experience these ""toys"" are causing significant morbidity and potential mortaliites among children.

This is the level of absurd reasoning behind this proposed safety standard.  It boggles my mind that people think it's OK to initiate a total prohibition on something that was never intended as a children's toy. Yes, unsupervised children may harm themselves with such magnets. They can also harm themselves with lighters, knives, pencils, stairs, and water.  I'm all for limiting the sale and availability of this item to children, as well as requiring proper safety warnings on packaging.

There have been heartbreaking suffering and lifetime adverse medical outcomes, which could be completely preventable.  Rare earth magnets are not toys, and not for consumer amusements.  Manufacturers who turn rare earth magnets into fun shapes and colors are putting profits ahead of children's lives.

I believe a formal hearing under 556&557 should be implemented in light of the facts, even if not statutorily required, in an abundance of caution and respect for the companies affected.  These organizations have worked with the CPSC and done everything needed, and now the organization is acting in such a manner contrary to their previous prior dealings with the effected companies.   As a consumer, I think the CPSC is overreaching. Personal responsibility is key. We don\'t let children play with ball bearings, and we have not banned every magnet out there because of the potential (ab)use by children. Parents should be responsible and not let these ADULT TOYS fall within their hands.  I believe that there should be a category promulgated that is classified as an ""ADULT TOY"" wherein the CPSC can designate particularly age-inappropriate items and disallow their sale at establishments where children may express an interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,
,"n years ago, when I  realized the zoos don't always operate with their animals best interest in mind. This is especially true of elephant programs across the country.  These large and magnificent animals are often kept in confined spaces and in climates that require them to be kept inside for long periods during the winter months. This treatment is in contrast to their life in the wild, where they would walk miles each day and are involved in complex social relationships.  Too often at zoos, we can see elephants swaying, nevously back and forth, showing the stress created in their situations. And, this stress can sometimes lead to aggression toward other elephants.  More serious are the various foot ailments caused by inactivity.   This includes painful infections that can lead to imobility and sometimes death.   Such foot ailments do not exist in the wild where the elephant can achieve its required level of activity.    Elephants are often a source of major income for zoos.  Please require  zoos to live up to their responsibilities and provide adequate living conditions for these magnificent and wonderous creatures.  Make zoos operate with the best interest of the elephant in mind."", 'Elephants are migrating creatures.  Being forced to be chained for 21 hours a day  goes against everything in them.

Please uphold the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and change the habitats of  these captive zoo elephants.  Increase the sizes of holding areas.  Provide for  socialization by grouping several elephants at a location.  And enrich their lives  with activities which would be natural to the species, like bathing, wallowing, and  foraging.

Circuses put our  children in danger and send the wrong message:  that\'s it\'s okay to take an  animal out of the wild and exploit it for profit.', 'Zoos and circuses do not provide elephants with the conditions they require for their health and well- being.These intelligent creatures lack adequate space and are forced to live in unnatural conditions.  As a result, they suffer from painful arthritis, foot disease, reproductive and digestive disorders, and  neurotic behaviors such as swaying and head bobbing. Both  circus elephants and many zoo  elephants are subjected to prolonged chaining, and to confinement in tiny stalls for extended  periods of time. Moreover, circuses and many zoos control their elephants through cruel and painful means. Whips  bullhooks and electric devices are unnecessary and should be outlawed.

It is well- known that captive elephants are dying prematurely from foot diseases associated  with lack of space and hard surfaces, including concrete and compacted dirt.  We  are in complete disagreement with The American Zoo and Aquarium Association  (AZA) setting a standard elephant enclosure at only 1,800 square feet per  elephant.  That is the equivalent of six parking spaces for the world?s largest land  mammal.  Captive elephants have also developed zoochosis, a psychological  behavior including head bobbing and swaying, from the lack of space for exercise  and/or socialization with other elephants.

Elephants in captivity look miserable. They do not receive  proper care in zoos and especially circuses. They have limited space, unnatural  conditions and are even subjected to painful controll methods.Some of these  animals spend up to 20 hours a day chained up, or most of the year in a tiny  boxcar for a traveling circus.

If people insist on having these animal in captivity, it is only for the people's  benefit, not the elephant's. Therefore, we should make the least possible stress  on the animal. Zoos should provide a natural type habitat, hundreds of acres for  the elephants to roam, so they can enjoy the life that God gave them. I don't belive  that these animals should be in circuses at all!!! It is such an unnatural  environment, traveling all the time. I belive that this is where the majority of the  cruelty is taking place. Many of the people have no real knowledge about these  animals, and therefore use painful methods to try to controll them. In my opinion  we need to step in and really enforce the Animal Welfare Act. Any organization  that is not following the law should be punished and banned from working with any  animals. People in our world are blinded by dollar signs, and we need to teach  them that life, whether it's human or not, is more precious than a dollar.

My concerns are as follows:  *Zoos and circuses do not provide elephants with the conditions they require for  their health and well-being. The Animal Welfare Act requires that zoos and  circuses provide elephants with adequate space. Neither zoos nor circuses  currently meet this requirement.   *In too many zoos and circuses, elephants suffer not only from lack of space, but  from unnatural conditions and social deprivation that eventually cause a range of  preventable ailments ? including painful arthritis, foot disease, reproductive and  digestive disorders, and neurotic behaviors such as swaying and head bobbing.  An estimated half of all captive elephants suffer from arthritis and foot disease,  and these ailments are the leading cause of euthanasia in captive elephants.   *Circus elephants are often subjected to prolonged chaining, spending up to 21  hours a day standing in chains and more than 11 months of the year traveling in  train boxcars, where they are again chained, and forced to endure extreme  temperatures and to stand for hours in their own waste. Many zoo elephants are  also subjected to prolonged chaining, and to confinement in barn stalls for  extended periods of time.   *Circuses and many zoos control their elephants through force, domination, and  aggressive use of the bullhook and other tools of intimidation such as whips,  clubs, and electric shock devices. These instruments are unnecessary and must  be outlawed.   *Exhibitors of elephants must be required to provide large, naturalistic  environments similar to those at The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the  Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) sanctuary in California. These two  refuges provide hundreds to thousands of acres over which elephants can roam,  socialize and maintain their health.   Thank you for your consideration of these issues.', 'It should be common sense that keeping other forms of life in an unnatural setting for most of their  lives soley for the purpose that another form of life on earth can be entertained is inherently wrong.   Life on earth has evolved to the state is is today to exist in certain natural settings that are  necessary for that species to survive and lead a normal life. Every fiber of it\'s being is directly tied  to that setting from the time it\'s born and throughout it\'s life.  To remove it from that natural  environment and force it to live in a restricted, artificial environment amounts to nothing less than  torture on a daily basis. No different than putting a human being in jail; only they did something  wrong to bring about that situation. No animal taken from their natural habitat in the wild ever did.  What are they being punished for ? It\'s time for the world to come out of the Dark Ages and co-exist with our fellow ""earthlings"" who  have as much right to live on this planet as they were intended as we do.', 'We have learned much more about elephant behavior in during the last  decade.Mostly, we have learned that these animals require social interaction, and  that to have a good elephant, it needs to be brought up and learn from its herd, or  older stable elephants in their sorroundings.. (Recent TV program about ""Killer  Elephants""in Africa hilighted this). They also need ample acreage to roam and  excercise or they will develop leg joint and arthritic problems forcing  them to live  their long lives in pain and discomfort. This is a cruel inhumane punsihment for  such a magnificent creature. We do this so that someone who goes to a Zoo or a  circus can have their 10 minutes of fun...we are better than this.  Do what is propper. Enforce rules and regulations that will force their keepers to  provide a suitable environment for their well being, and if they can not, they must  transfer them to Wild Animal Parks or santuaries where their needs will be met.  Baby elephants should under no circumastances be born and brought up in zoos  unless they will grow in a herd and exposed to other members of their kind. The  laws must have teeth, and it must hurt them where it counts, namely their  pocketbooks', ""It is bad enough that elephants are taken out of their natural environments and  made into entertainment slaves.  But they aren't even given enough space to have  a somewhat natural life.  Respect for these mighty animals is sorely needed.

If tuberculosis/trunk washes are monitored, so should any other  problems related to the welfare of captive elephants, including arthritis and  osteomyelitis.  Indeed, the zoos and circuses are the ones who should be doing  the research and creating the ?science? behind the findings.  Zoos and Ringling  Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus, especially, should be involved as they have  stated repeatedly that they are working to conserve elephants.  A truly ?natural? death of an elephant is starvation, which happens when the last  set of teeth is worn down and the animal can no longer chew food.  An animal that  has the nutritional and medical advantages of good veterinary care, regular  food and exercise; and none of the perils of life in the wild (drought, poachers,  human  expansion, falling down a well, snake bite, etc.) should meet the longer lifespan of  60-70 years, not the 35-40 year lifespan elephants in captivity currently experience.  Other captive animals have a longer lifespan in captivity than in the wild; why not  elephants?', 'I do not believe elephants or any wild animal for that matter should live their lives in captivity.   These animals are prevented from acting on any of their natural instincts such as migration,  socialization, forresting, grooming...  Zoos and circuses can never give animals any life resembling  the life they were meant to live.  Both exploit animals for the sake of human entertainment.   Regulating the size of a cage in an attempt to improve their quality of life is misdirected  intervention.

I look forward for everyone to have the opportunity to visit SeaWorld and other marine mammal parks for years to come.', ""I am not a marine mammal trainer, but I am someone who has visited marine animal parks and has had up close and personal interactions with marine mammals in a marine mammal park setting. I am also a member of the International Marine Animal Trainers Association (IMATA) because I believe in and support what marine animal trainers do. I believe that the standards of animal care and the regulations as they currently stand are adequate, and there is no need to modify what is currently in place unless irrefutable and scientifically proven data suggests otherwise.   I also firmly believe that if any modifications or revisions to current protocol are warranted they should come from established professionals with factual data, and not from animal rights activists with an anti-marine park agenda. I have always firmly believed that the welfare of these animals should be left in the hands of the loving and caring professionals who care for them daily. They are the ones who truly know these animals, and know what these animals need. I have experienced firsthand, and I have seen the care and attention these animals receive, and I believe that care is superior. Allow me to offer an example. In 2014 I participated in the Trainer for a Day program at Discovery Cove in Orlando, Florida. Under the direct and constant supervision of a Discovery Cove trainer I interacted with birds, small mammals, dolphins, and sharks. Throughout my entire experience I observed nothing but the utmost in superior care and maintenance that these animals receive. These animals were free to interact with guests at their own choosing. In fact, one dolphin kept returning to our group to interact with us entirely of its own volition with no commands given by any trainer to do so. At no time did any animal exhibit any signs of stress or non-compliance. No animal was forced to participate or confined to our group in any way. These animals were free to swim away from our group in a vast and spacious area. At any time any of these animals could swim away from us, but none did.    If ANY changes are indeed warranted with regard to animal welfare, I believe that these recommendations should come from experienced animal care professionals with fact based data to prove their points. I also believe that the claims made by animal rights activists should have no bearing on changing clearly established animal care protocols. Animals deserve to be respected and cared for to the best of our human abilities, but they are still animals. We as humans have been granted dominion over them since the Biblical times. We should always treat them with the utmost respect and care, but animals are not equal to us. The animal rights groups would seek to declare them as non-human persons. Clearly they are intelligent beings capable of learning the behaviors that humans teach them, but they are not human. The animal rights activists have a very clear agenda of trying to influence the public that keeping these animals in captivity is wrong. Abusive forms of captivity are wrong and should be abolished, yes. HOWEVER, the vast and overwhelming majority of captive animals in this country are treated with respect and a high standard of care in accordance with or exceeding the federal standard. In every single instance in which I have interacted with a marine mammal as part of the guest programs at SeaWorld and Discovery Cove, I saw animals that were maintained in the highest standard and quality of care. These animals appeared healthy and happy and eager to interact with guests of their own free will. These animals were never forced or compelled to do anything they didn't want to do, nor were they punished for refusing. Quite frankly, I don't understand these proposed changes in your current rules when the existing ones work perfectly in my assessment.   As I said, if ANY changes are warranted, they should be presented by established and reputable animal care professionals, and backed up by irrefutable data and research. If we start letting radical animal rights activists dictate the level of care these animals get, you will set a dangerous precedent that will have a negative ripple effect across the entire planet. I say just leave the rules as they are, and leave the care of these animals in the qualified hands of their trainers and other trained caregivers. They work with these animals every day and know them intimately. They are the ones who should be consulted on any proposed rules changes, not a group of radical animal rights activists with a clear agenda of ridding the world of all captive animals."", 'Please help these facilities help our planet!  I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

That said, surely wise regulations should be based upon solid science.  My experience with Dolphin Quest in Bermuda was exceptional.', 'Dolphin Quest are doing fabulous, educational work.  let them carry on!', 'NO additional regulations should be placed on organizations such as Dolphin Quest.  New regulations that are being suggested by the misinformed.  There is great value of organizations such as these for humans and Dolphins alike.  The animals are treated in a humane manner and well cared for.  I believe in the ""swim with the dolphin programs"" as they provide very positive experiences for people and dolphins.  And these programs ultimately lead to active participation by many people in the caring for these animals in and out of their natural habitat. I am very familiar with these programs and will vouch that these programs should not only continue, but must be expanded.  The addition to current regulations are not done through science,  but by people who have no understanding of animal welfare and only have their personal ""feelings"" as to what they perceive as something that does not exist. Please do not waste our governments resources and the citizens of this country\'s time to enact regulations  or laws that have no valid scientific data behind these ridiculous decisions which are made by people who do not have the ability to do so. NO changes. Leave things alone.  These programs exist to promote the care and respect these animals need  by allowing understanding and interaction between these animals and humans. Please feel free to contact me, for comments or information:', 'As a close friend of the International Marine Animal Trainers\' Association (IMATA), an organization representing the individuals who have dedicated their professional lives to actually providing daily care to marine animals in zoological settings, I can assure you that our members\' first priority is to act as the guarantors of the welfare of those in their charge.    IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species  to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.  After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.  If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.  Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.  With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.    Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.   I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  All one needs to do is OBSERVE mammals in their NATURAL environment to understand their innate needs to live as intended.  There is NO SEA PARK that can SIMULATE THE OCEAN, therefore we must work toward the goal of no captivity allowed at all.  These mammals need global laws for protection if they are to survive the many perils they now face.  (There are entirely too many nonhumans in dwindling numbers due to humans\' negative impact).  I vote for NO MORE SEA PARKS, a gradual transition to sanctuaries for mammals who cannot live free, and the introduction of Sea Life Learning Centers for the public. These educational facilities could actually become quite profitable & provide positive entertainment as well as ensure that our future sea life will continue to exist for generations to come.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established.

Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals.

Please reconsider these offensive regulations.', 'I am the Education Outreach Coordinator for Hollywild Animal Park in South Carolina.  I have been in the zoological field for 13 years, not including three years of internships during college.  I have been a member of AZA and AAZK throughout my employment at AZA facilities (SeaWorld Orlando, Brevard Zoo, Greenville Zoo).  I am currently working at a non-AZA facility in hopes that my knowledge and skills can assist them in reaching their desired AZA accreditation status.  Throughout my career I have cared for and trained numerous species including marine mammals.  I have had the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the regulations and would like to submit the below comments for consideration.  The additional regulation components specific to interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of programs. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation, or how further regulation would benefit marine mammals.  As a trainer, I feel that if interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, programs in which trainers bring marine mammals, such as, but not limited to pinnipeds, into a public area under stimulus control.  I cannot support the proposed rule, which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day. With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.  With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.  As a trainer, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision-making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.  I do understand that with the events that have transpired in the past several years, policies and procedures are being looked at closely and updated.  I do want to stress that when looking at policies, do not ignore the science or the successes due to the overwhelming voices of those not in the profession who spout emotion and not science.  Please look to those scientists who are doing research to help us ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any animal would eventually turn  on their handler if treated in this manner.  Elephants do not belong in circuses.

Elephants shoud only be allowed to be kept in sanctuaries that replicate a natural  existence. For once, do the morally right thing.', ""Following scrutiny from the media and the public over the plight of elephants in  circuses and zoos, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is currently  seeking public comments regarding all aspects of captive elephant care, including  cruel training devices such as bullhooks and electric prods, chaining, and lack of  space. The federal Animal Welfare Act does not have any standards or regulations  that address elephants' special needs.  Circuses and many zoos control elephants through the use of force and  domination, aggressive use of bullhooks, and prolonged chaining. In many zoos,  elephants are confined to barn stalls for at least 12 hours a day when zoos are  closed, and in zoos in cold climates, elephants often spend weeks at a time  indoors during cold winter weather.  Elephants are the world's largest land mammals, and they require significant  amounts of space. In fact, in the wild, they can walk up to 30 miles a day. The  leading causes of death in captive elephants are foot disorders and arthritis, which  are caused by prolonged chaining, intense confinement, and forced inactivity.  Since 2000, more than half of the 49 elephants who have died at zoos accredited  by the Aquarium & Zoo Association never reached their 40th birthdays, dying far  short of their 70-year life expectancies.  Because of their intelligence, complexity, sensitivities, and unique social and  physical needs, elephants suffer immensely in small, unchallenging captive  environments. To make matters worse for elephants, in circuses, every instinctual  behavior is subject to discipline. If elephants reach for grass, try to comfort friends,  or extend their trunks to smell something new or different, they get hit with  bullhooks. If they blow a trick during a performance, they get beaten afterward.  Despite the fact that elephants fare miserably in captivity, zoos and circuses are  vociferously defending the status quo.   I VEHEMENTLY SUPPORT all efforts to drastically improve conditions for captive  elephants in this country. Ask the USDA to create tough new standards, such as  the following:  ? The use of bullhooks should be prohibited. These barbaric devices have only one  purpose: to inflict pain. In addition, the federal Animal Welfare Act should include a  ban on the use of electric-shock devices, chaining, and other instruments that  cause pain, injury, and suffering to elephants. ? Exhibitors of elephants should be required to provide large, climate-appropriate  environments that resemble elephants' natural habitats?similar to those at The  Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and the Performing Animal Welfare Society  sanctuary in California.

Before such rash decisions are made, we need to gather appropriate research to see if any changes will harm the animals as well as the human beings that come to learn. Sea World has always been an educational facility, but they are also a business. In order to perform their research, they need money, and let\'s face it- it\'s a pretty big ocean out there.The entertainment aspect is what attracts people in to their parks more than zoos- they get to see these animals in a way that connects to them- it entrances them, entertains them, and that causes a positive emotion and reaction. And you must admit- it worked- because their income and attendance at their parks far surpassed their neighboring zoos. Through their income, they have been able to research and educate thousands of people.  As I look back on my life, I notice how I learned more about oceanic life from Sea World than I learned in school. The reason: schools have books and instruction- Sea World provides experiences.

I thoroughly enjoyed every visit as a spectator and participant in DRC's interactive programs. I have attended many other marine mammal parks both nationally and internationally and I chose the DRC to become a more serious student of marine mammal biology, care, and training as well as conservation and preservation. Recently I completed DRC's week-long adult dolphin lab program in March.   I have also committed to attending DRC's  career series education program offered in May and June.  I truly appreciate that APHIS works to ensure that high standards are met for the optimum care of all marine mammals in captivity and recognizes the value of U.S. Marine Mammal Parks in their role to provide education to the public.    Having had the opportunity to be fully immersed in an interactive dolphin experience, I observed that the entire dolphin population residing at DRC appears to be happy, well cared for and that they enjoy their various human interactions.    For me, the most memorable connections are when I have the opportunity to be in the water with the dolphins. The Dolphin Encounter program is DRC's swim program. Each time I have participated, the dolphins seem to enjoy the session as much as I do. It is always a special treat when I'm able to interact with two dolphins at the same time, especially during a tandem dorsal pull or when they try to imitate my actions into an appropriate behavior.  I stand in awe watching the interactions between the dolphins and the trainers.  I felt total confidence in the knowledge of all the trainers and view them as true professionals.  DRC's trainers and staff work diligently to maintain a clean habitat for the dolphins.  I have watched staff members routinely clean and maintain the docks, fences, and gate enclosures and remove any debris that may have floated or been blown in from the surrounding environment. The dolphins at DRC are fortunate to live in their natural habitat.  As can be expected, water clarity of the DRC lagoons can varyoften the water is very clear but sometimes after inclement weather or natural dolphin play, the water can appear a bit cloudy.  Since water clarity can be affected by natural causesI assume these conditions are not too dissimilar from the experiences of dolphins in the wild.  I do not believe my safety was in any way encumbered on days when the water was less clear.  Nor did it seem to affect the dolphins' welfare or the trainers' ability to care for them.  I thereby think the proposed regulation on water clarity is unreasonable when it relates to marine mammals living in their natural habitat.   I have been fortunate that DRC has provided many educational opportunities for me to grow and share knowledge.  I hope to one day share the knowledge I gained at the DRC with landlocked adults and children who have not had the opportunity to connect with the oceans or its inhabitants, and to spread my passion for ocean conservation.  There is no question that the dolphins residing at DRC are loved and cared for deeply. I have witnessed that every aspect of their care and well-being is continually addressed. I felt truly confident in the expertise of each trainer that has been dockside. They know the individual personalities of each dolphin and their exuberance and genuine passion enable these dolphins to engage in human interactions with enjoyable challenges.    Thanking you for this opportunity to express my opinion regarding the agency's proposed rules."", 'To who it may concern  I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

I look forward to have the opportunity to visit SeaWorld and other marine mammal parks for years to come.', 'Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on your proposed rules for marine mammals.  Because excellent animal health and welfare are the goals of APHIS regulations, we are fortunate to have  a strong community of professional marine mammal specialistsveterinarians, trainers, and handlerswho, collectively,  have a long history of working hands-on with all the species of marine mammals that are in marine parks and zoos,  as well as those that have stranded on beaches in every coastal state. These specialists work with the animals every day,  around the clock, year after year. Their demonstrated expertise, experience, scientific knowledge, and dedication to the health and welfare of these animals are unsurpassed. I urge that any modifications to the regulations be based on the most current science and information from this marine mammal professional community of specialists that have the most  experience with the animals.  At our Dolphin Quest facilities, the animals are given exemplary care in large and enriched environments. We are proud  that we meet and exceed the Animal Welfare Act standards regarding animals under human care. We also have a strong  historical record of success and safety in our human-dolphin interactions. Based on that record, I believe that additional  regulations on interactive programming are unwarranted.   Marine parks and zoos provide the only reliable and safe opportunities for the public to see, learn about, and, in some cases,  to interact with living marine mammals. Over the four decades that I have been a marine mammal conservation educator, I  have visited almost every marine mammal public-display facility in the U.S. and I know that these facilities play a crucial  role in raising awareness and knowledge about ocean animals, the environment, and conservation. Seeing and interacting  with marine mammals create emotional connections that result in people caring about the animals; and these experiences inspire people to engage in stewardship behaviors. Given the deteriorating conditions of wild places all over our planet,  marine mammal public-display facilities are sanctuaries for the animals where humans are learning and reconnecting to nature.', 'I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

Thank you for your time and consideration.', 'We are long-time members and supporters of the Dolphin Research Center (DRC) and, as such, are vitally interested in the proposed changes for regulation of marine mammal facilities and husbandry.  We have participated in many different kinds of interactions with both dolphins and sea lions at DRC over the years, including swim programs, shallow water programs, and dry programs.   We appreciate APHIS\'s work and laud the effort to keep both animals and people safe.   Two of the proposed changes are of particular concern. First, the stipulation that the dolphins are visible at all times during an interactive program. The natural-water lagoons at DRC vary in depth and are subject to the vagaries of wind and weather. The trainers are able to see the dolphins at all times when interacting with guests, but may not have clear visibility when the dolphins are demonstrating behaviors away from the docks and people.  Secondly, the stipulation that each dolphin must have its own trainer is excessive. The dolphins and trainers at DRC are accustomed to working with two or three dolphins per trainer, and have been trained to ""take turns,"" and wait at their ""stations"" until their turns come around. There are also circumstances in which young dolphins choose to accompany their elders when performing behaviors with guests - much to the delight of all participants.   The dolphins at DRC live joyful lives at this wonderful, natural-water facility. Safety for both the human guests and marine mammal residents has always been the primary concern in all interactive programs.   Additionally - DRC continues to enrich our lives and those of every single guest, with narrated sessions educating us about these wonderful animals and messages of conservation and treatment of their wild relatives. We have seen and experienced the powerful impact getting to know these animals has made on many lives - from the children\'s eyes widening in wonder watching the dolphins\' athleticism, to the glee of splash imitations, to our own appreciation of their intelligence, ability to learn, and willingness, even eagerness, to share their world with us.  Continuing support of marine mammal facilities is vital.

Walton Beach, Fl in 1948 I was thrilled in the 50's when my parents took me and my siblings to the newly  opened Gulfarium Marine Park. What an impact it had on us at an early age to appreciate the beauty and intelligence of the animals we saw.  In later years we would take our two sons to the Gulfarium and I saw the same fascination in their eyes that I had in mine. I  even had one of their birthday parties there, might have been the best one we ever had because of the excitement from all the kids. Today it's the grandkids and we truly can wait to see their faces the first time we take them to the park.  I believe this experience for my wife and I, our sons and our grandkids helps build an appreciation and better understanding of these animals. It's educational for us and in watching the animals I think they enjoy doing what they do as much as we  enjoy watching.  These animals are certainly well cared for and it's obvious the love the staff has for them. I'm glad the APHIS has strict  regulations and inspections for all facilities such as this one.

I was flabbergasted to see that Molly was still around in her mid 50\'s and doing well. It is because of the extreme care that she and all the dolphins and seals at the DRC receive that these beloved dolphins live such long and happy lives. I was also very glad  to see Kathy Roberts again. She has been there for 35 wonderful years.  She, Mandy, and so many others have dedicated their entire lives to this tremendous facility.

The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Marine mammals deserve much better conditions than proposed.  Enormous changes are necessary to meet minimum ""humane"" treatment for creatures that should never be in captivity at all!  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'As an educated engineer and scientist I regret that government officials are pressured to make important decisions that are based on a flawed understanding of facts, nature, and science by well meaning anti-scientific extremists.

IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species  to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'I am a supporter of accredited zoological facilities and aquariums and marine parks and have been personally inspired by my experiences at Georgia Aquarium.  I applaud APHIS for evaluating, and where necessary, updating the regulations by objectively assessing the latest peer reviewed science and input from industry experts on the best practices for care of these incredible animals. I am concerned that individuals and groups opposed to marine mammals in a zoological settings misuse the process of updating marine mammal care regulations in their attempts to end the display marine mammals.  They do so by encouraging APHIS to impose rules which are not necessary, counter to decades of successful care programs and processes, and impede the great education and conservation work done by the zoological community.  I encourage APHIS to evaluate the marine mammal care regulations based upon on the merits of applicable peer reviewed literature and current best practice standards; in cases where insufficient literature exists, input and observation of successful practices within the industry should be strongly considered. I work directly with the millions of guests that are welcomed at Georgia Aquarium each year. I have had the experience of seeing guests of all ages see aquatic animals and ecosystems they may never see in their lifetime and strike a deeper understanding of the one world ocean that connects us all. All of us at Georgia Aquarium are committed to providing our guests with a positive and impactful experience to inspire conservation of our aquatic world. I believe changes to the APHIS rules that could ultimately end the display of marine mammals would deny millions of people the ability to see magnificent animals and learn more about them. APHIS should take careful consideration to evaluate the marine mammal care regulations based on the merits of the applicable peer reviewed literature and current best practices standards. I work with the thousands of students that are educated at Georgia Aquarium each year. At Georgia Aquarium we are committed to educating guests and students of all ages about our aquatic ecosystems and the animals that live within them. Students are able to see marine mammals that they may never see in their lifetime and foster a deeper understanding of the ocean that connects us all.  Georgia Aquarium is located in Atlanta, GA, a land-locked city, students are able to see thousands of different animals from all over the world in one location to connect their learning even further. I believe changes to the APHIS rules that could ultimately end the display of marine mammals would deny millions of students the opportunity to connect what they learn in the classroom with real-world applications at an accredited zoo and aquarium. APHIS should take careful consideration to evaluate the marine mammal care regulations based on the merits of the applicable peer reviewed literature and current best practice standards. I think that any new or revised animal care regulations such as these should be based on scientific studies and knowledge from experts who have years of experience caring for marine mammals.  The rules should not be based on opinions that are unsupported by the facts or experience.    I have participated in the dolphin interactive programs at Marineland Dolphin Adventure and was inspired to care about the magnificent bottlenose dolphin. The interactive program was incredible, safe, and well executed by professional trainers. During our program, the staff clearly emphasized the safety of the animals AND the participants was their top priority, and while they certainly hoped we had a positive experience, it was also essential the animals had a very positive experience as well. It is clear, through this experience, Marineland is managing the needs of both guests and the animals that participate in the programs. Therefore, I do not see a need for further regulations on interactive programs. They are very sage and the dolphins appear to thrive and enjoy it.', 'I love SeaWorld and the Columbus Oh Zoo and see how well the staff and trainers take care of and support the animals in their care.  I so miss the water interaction with the trainer and killer whales at SeaWorld.   The interaction was so awesome and always touched my heart you could see the love between the whale and trainer.  There is no question that marine parks like SeaWorld are critical to not only the well-being of animals in human care but to continued rescue and rehabilitation of those in the wild. Please guard against making changes to your regulations based on input from those who fail to recognize the critical educational and inspirational importance of zoos and aquariums.   Based on my visits to SeaWorld there is no question that the animals are thriving and well cared for by passionate animal care experts.

Marine mammal parks, along with other zoos and aquariums, are the best resource we have to educate the public about the natural world and to inspire them to protect it.  Any attempt to limit public interactions with animals at these facilities would hurt conservation efforts. APHIS and the USDA should focus on protecting animal related jobs and human-animal interactions, be they in zoology, training, rescue, farming, performing, veterinary, service, or private ownership, from the unfounded and emotional attacks of uneducated animal rights zealots.

My concern is that we may be tempted toward a reactive response to what may be a misguided knee-jerk, or emotionally driven goal of the elimination of those facilities that maintain animals in human care    I work directly with much of the public that passes through Marineland Dolphin Adventure and can see the inspirational value of our interaction with them.    While I consider quality care to be a critical component of what we do, ( in itself is a lesson of respect of the wellbeing of animal life in general.), it is important that the regulatory agencies not find themselves being used as a tool by those that have much more on their agenda than the quality of care toward these animals while being presented to the public to educate, and inspire consideration for these animals in their natural habitats.', 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Please acknowledge current scientific information and UPDATE 30 year old policy.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.

,,"ale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', ""Thank you for your diligent commitment to animal welfare. I recommend that any modifications to the APHIS regulations be based on the most current science and information from the marine mammal specialists who have the most experience with these animals.

Many people, including me, might never have the opportunity to see these amazing animals if it weren't for these facilities.

My organization participated and spoke at the hearing of Bill 80 seeking to ban the importation and breeding of orcas into this Province and the Bill became law.  I also attended at the Minister\'s office with Dr. Ingrid Visser, marine biologist and the only researcher specializing in orca in New Zealand waters, in order to provide input regarding the Standards of Care for Marine Mammals which has since been implemented in the Province of Ontario.  I would first like to applaud your decision to amend the regulations of the Animal Welfare Act concerning the humane handling, care, treatment and transportation of marine mammals in captivity. I wish to provide the following comments supported by current science and/or industry best practice:  1. I vigorously encourage you to review the scientific data referenced in the comments submitted by Animal Welfare Institute with regard to improving the welfare of captive marine mammals.  The scientific understanding of marine mammals has grown exponentially since the captive marine mammal regulations were last revised and I encourage you to reflect this growth in knowledge in the revised regulations.  In particular, I urge you to consult the following publication: Aquatic Mammals (the journal of the European Association of Aquatic Mammals, a professional association of the regulated community), entitled ""A survey of the environments of cetaceans in human care"" (Couquiaud 2005).  I strongly urge APHIS to consult the full range of available scientific literature on relevant aspects of marine mammal biology and ecology to inform its efforts while finalizing this rule.  2.  Of particular concern to me is APHIS has chosen not to amend the current space requirements, which is simply unacceptable given the large body of recent research demonstrating the fine-scale daily movement patterns of various species of marine mammals.  I urge you to re-examine the research in finalizing your determination regarding space requirements.  Even though captive cetaceans are provided food and do not have to forage and travel long distances for that purpose, science has proven that if they do not exercise or remain active then they suffer serious health consequences.  The failure to revise the current space requirements in light of current science on this topic in my opinion is the greatest shortcoming and failure of the proposed rule to make significant improvements to captive marine mammal welfare.  Lolita currently resides in an inexcusably small tank in Miami which is clearly detrimental to her welfare..  3.   As well, the proposed rule does not include any noise standards for indoor or outdoor facilities, nor does it explain or justify this omission in any way. Yet in several instances, licensee noise levels, particularly in-air, are extremely high (e.g., in some theme parks, virtually every night, there is a fireworks display directly over marine mammal enclosures; in others, roller coasters are placed in close proximity to marine mammal enclosures . The publication I referenced earlier Couquiaud (2005) includes a section on noise concerns (pp. 344- 345) and offers some common sense recommendations to mitigate noise. I strongly recommend that APHIS formulate noise standards and consult Couquiaud (2005) when doing so.  4.  i oppose feeding/petting programs which allow the public to handle and provide food to the animals, an activity that is otherwise restricted to trained personnel in the regulations (see  3.105(c): ""...food...must be given by an employee or attendant responsible to management who has the necessary knowledge to assure that each marine mammal receives an adequate quantity of food to maintain it in good health"" By definition, feeding/petting programs violate this section of the regulations and thus cannot simply be ignored.   5. I strongly support the proposed change to require shade for marine mammals housed outdoors.  I personally proposed that change to the Minister to include in Ontario\'s Standard of Care for Marine Mammals and it was in fact implemented.  6.  I strongly  oppose interactive programs (eg. swim with dolphin programs), as science has proven them to be an additional stressor for species already stressed by baseline captive conditions, a hazard for the human participants, and, an activity that perpetuates an inconsistent message to the public about the appropriateness of close contact with wildlife. I also strongly oppose the space requirement proposed changes as the proposed changes to the space requirements for bottlenose dolphins in current  3.104 are already completely inadequate to safeguard the welfare of the animals, let alone protect the safety of swimmers.  7. I oppose reducing the time period during which records must be kept from 3 years in the current regulations to 1 year in the proposed, and that interactive programs be required to keep records.', 'I have worked in no less than 3 facilities in which animals are in human care.

It is clear to me that the dolphins, sea lions, and seals enjoy the sessions as much as the people. I brought my young daughter to the park where she was able to interact with the dolphins.  They were very friendly and absolutely chose to participate.  They were never forced.  This interaction increased my family's commitment to conservation and support of the environment that we live in.  These animals brought so much joy to us and have helped me teach my young daughter about compassion and animal welfare.

I have seen firsthand the impact that an encounter with an animal can have. These facilities give people the chance to observe and interact with animals that they may never get a chance to see in person otherwise. Myself and countless others have been amazed by these interactions and were inspired to make changes in our daily lives to protect their wild counterparts. My visits to SeaWorld and then Marineland and the wonderful staff that I met there were what inspired and continue to motivate me to pursue a career in marine science, and I continue to share my passion for animals and conservation with everyone I meet. I know many others who share this sentiment: their experience at a zoological facility taught them how to be a better steward of the environment.  The standards set by APHIS ensure that all facilities are giving their animals top-quality care, and I appreciate that these standards are being evaluated. It is important that there is a place for people to go to learn about and admire marine mammals in an environment that is safe for them and the animals. It is also important that these standards are continually reviewed as we learn more about animal care through research and experience.  Unfortunately, there is currently a vocal minority who feel very strongly that marine mammals do not belong in human care. While this is a valid opinion, there is no scientific evidence that marine mammals are not thriving in zoological facilities because the standards of care are so high. Those people who oppose marine mammals in human care are free to choose not to visit, but it is important that those places are still available for the rest of us who see their great importance to society and the environment.', 'Inhumane, plain and simple', 'Interactive exhibits:  It is a good safety feature to always have a second staff person out of the water and ready to respond in case of anything unforeseen happening.

While I am appreciative of the government\'s intentions I am reminded of one thing.  Experience and history are better bases for decisions than good intentions.  I truly believe that Dolphin Research Center is the most qualified voice for marine mammal treatment.  So I would advise APHIS to avail themselves of and heed their counsel.    My wife and I have been members there for over twenty years.  We have had the memorable experiences of both the dock activity ""Meet the Dolphin"" and lagoon swim ""Dolphin Encounter"".  As with an adolescent\'s first kiss, you never forget your first dolphin kiss.  And the dorsal fin pull is an exhilarating experience that you will relive the rest of your life.  I was able to get a picture of my wife as the dolphins pulled her around the lagoon and there was sheer ecstasy on her face.  At the dock activity we had a single trainer with a single dolphin.  In the water we had a single trainer with the two dolphins.  To put things in perspective, my wife is a natural strong swimmer......I swim like a rock.  I can swim but have always been tentative around water.  However, in neither of the above instances did I have any feeling of fear or apprehension.  I was able to relax and enjoy the inter-action with our two beautiful dolphins.  I can see absolutely no reason to require a trainer for each dolphin during activities.  These are docile gentle creatures.  To think that it requires a trainer for each one to handle them is ludicrous.  When was the last time you saw eight drivers with the Budweiser Clydesdales?    If you want clear water viewing of sealife go to Mote Marine or Disney World.  But for the natural true life viewing you go to DRC where Mother Nature handles the water and recirculates the lagoon continually.  Many a time I would love to see what is testing my bobber in the creek.  But that is just not ""natural"".  At the fish market you ""see what you get"".  In the creek it is just whatever happens to be down there.  We have become ambassadors for our wonderful marine mammals over the years.  I am not afraid to tell somebody to ""not feed the wild dolphins"" or to another ""slow down to idle no-wake speed in manatee areas"".  In fact, after we introduced our daughter-in-law to dolphins she became so enthralled with them that she changed her college major and went into animal behaviorism.  After interning at Mote and DRC she has now been in research at Disney World for over ten years.  Consequently, our granddaughter has become a new generation of ambassador due to our initial membership at DRC.  There is even a paving brick with her name and date of birth on it in one of the walkways.

In my career I have cared for and trained many different animals including marine mammals. The one constant I believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of all animals including marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best.  Each animal should be treated as an individual requiring different variations in training based on the individuals welfare.  In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesira",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"ble"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'I  have been a professional animal trainer for 34 years. I hold memberships in the following professional organizations:  AZA, IAATE and AMBA. I have had the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the regulations and would like to submit the below comments for consideration.  INTERACTIVE PROGRAMS The additional regulation components specific to interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of programs. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation, or how further regulation would benefit marine mammals.  As a trainer, I feel that if interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, programs in which trainers bring marine mammals, such as, but not limited to pinnipeds, into a public area under stimulus control.

In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. That would be like saying someone shouldn\'t walk their dog or give it attention for more than 3 hours a day when that dog lives for the attention from it\'s owner/trainer.

PART 3: CONCLUSION  I would like to thank APHIS for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you also recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and that you did not feel compelled to unnecessarily change regulations. Thank you!', 'I believe that it is extremely important for people to be able to have up close and personal experiences with animals in order to create a bond and a passion to protect them in the wild.  Zoos and aquariums exist to educate and foster a desire to make changes and conserve the environment for animals in the wild. I strongly believe that any changes made to the APHIS regulations should be carefully considered and backed by the most current science and research.  Dolphin Quest and other marine mammal facilities not only give people like myself and my family the opportunity to get up close and personal with  animals that we otherwise will have never been able to see, but they also employ the best animal health care and provide invaluable research opportunities that are only possible with trained dolphins that have created mutually trusting and beneficial relationship. Thank you,  Lyndsey Warmuth', 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Most of the folks I know now believe captive marine mammals businesses should be phased out.  The public wants an end to captivity businesses.  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'With all the misinformation being spread about Sea World, other aquariums and zoological facilities, it is concerning to see the federal government side with militant animal welfare organizations such as PETA.

I myself am very active in dog rescue and have seen and dealt with the aftermath of deplorable conditions, neglect, and poor nutrition. Places that keep animals in those situations should be shut down.   That said, the places who follow protocol and have happy, healthy animals, like Oceans of Fun at the Milwaukee County Zoo, must be kept running. Oceans of Fun is NOT your regular ""sea lion show"". It is education in one of its purest forms. The ""tricks"" are to show the audience things like bone structure, diet, and special abilities. Each show ends with the sea lion picking up ""garbage"" to bring home the fact that pollution in our oceans effects their natural habitat.  Oceans of Fun makes these animals real for their audience. My 8 y/o wants to make the world a better place because of the conservation tips and facts she learned there and because of the real life animals she saw there. If the show were shut down, people would lose that face to face connection. Out of sight, out of mind. If people cannot see these magnificent creatures, there will be a disconnect and we will not be able to understand how our actions are part of something bigger. We\'ll lose the importance of sea creatures in our ecosystem.   Please allow the show to go on.', ""Improved conditions is an absolute priority.  We've seen so many cases recently of sick animals, particularly marine mammals, in captivity.  These improved conditions are indisputable.  However, temporary variances for size requirements should not even be considered.  Transition periods are particularly stressful on these animals and the least we can do is afford them the legally required space mandated. I would actually like to see an increase in minimum tank size mandated and stipulations for only rehabilitated marine mammals to be accepted into captivity."", 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals.

During my multiple visits over the past years, I have participated in interactive programs and also spent time watching many sessions between the dolphins, sea lions and their trainers.  In every instance, I was impressed by the staff's dedication to loving and caring for the animals, their high level of expertise, and the clean environments in which the animals live.  It is clear to me that the dolphins enjoy the sessions as much as the people.  They appear to choose to participate and are never forced.  In the dolphin swim programs, I have always particularly enjoyed when I got to play with two dolphins at a time.  They sure seemed to like teaming up for the dorsal pull or fun imitations and other behaviors.  The trainers do a superior job.  I do not feel that my safety was ever at risk, even when one trainer worked with more than one dolphin at a time.  Nor do I feel that the natural water environment and deep lagoon added any risk to my safety during the relatively short periods of time when the trainer and I might not be able to see the dolphins.  I have learned so much about the animals, the environment, and the importance of conservation.  They have inspired me to improve my personal actions in my daily life and in my support of the environment around me.  I'd like to thank you for your diligent commitment to animal welfare.

They program is enlightening and vital to the survival of these beautiful creatures.   Please consider that many organization such as Dolphin Quest do not do this solely for the money.  They provide these encounters to teach the public about dolphins.  They spend precious dollars on research.  They spend the most money on care.   It would be a shame to lose such an organization due to government regulations. Another reason we chose Dolphin Quest is for our son.  Just as equine therapy is important to people with autism, dolphins are equally as sensitive.  This encounter brought out a child who doesn't usually express emotion properly.  It was a beautiful symbiotic relationship if only for 40 minutes."", 'First of all, I want to thank you for what your organization does. Animals that are in human care need to be so to the best of all abilities.    I have had some experience with dolphins at the Dolphin Research Center, located in Grassy Key, FL. My first visit, which was almost 20 years ago, changed my life. I had previously seen dolphins at aquariums, but to see them in their natural environment was amazing! They seemed so happy to be interacting with each other and with the guests.I did not do an interaction on that first visit, but went away with the feeling that my young daughter would love this place. Since then, I have spent many days  at DRC, mainly because my daughter studied hard in college and then was hired in the Animal Care and Training department. I have also been in the water many times with numerous dolphins with just one trainer. Never did I feel in danger or feel that the trainer did not have a great sense of control over the entire session. The dolphins seem to really enjoy interacting both with the other dolphins and the humans. In fact, it is my understanding that no dolphin is ever forced into interaction. If they don\'t want to, they don\'t have to. That is one way to ensure safety.    One other issue I feel strongly about is the water. I do not feel that a dolphin needs to be seen at all times. Not one time did I worry because I couldn\'t see where a dolphin was. This is their natural environment! And also the ""not clear"" water helps protect their skin from the sun. They are allowed to swim deep which is important for them. I don\'t think that any guest has ever been injured due to the water clarity level.    In closing, I want to mention how deeply dedicated the staff at DRC is. They care so deeply about the birds, dolphins and sea lions in their care and work tirelessly to educate the guests about not just the dolphins,  but also the environment and the world around them. I\'m not sure that you can find a more caring group of people.

,,"unity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'IF you are going to continue to allow captive animals, I believe the rules should consist of the following:  1) TANKS need to be made significantly larger, at the expense of the marine park holding the animals. 2) NO MORE animals can be taken from the wild.  NO MORE subsidizing the dolphin slaughters in Taiji, Japan, and other countries. 3) NO MORE THAN 1 swim-with-dolphin per day...it is unfair to the dolphin to make it do things for strangers more often than that. 4) Optimally, marine captive animals should be given open water to swim in, a lagoon...  that animal welfare rules have not dramatically changed is ridiculous, and only shows that USDA and government is in the hand of special interests once again, as always.;', 'I believe that ALL animals should be well cared for BUT I feel that regulations being implemented by the USDA and local ordinances are trying to turn animals into lab experiments.  Animals do need proper space, feed and care but those spaces do not need to be sterol, they just need to be clean.  The spaces need to allow an animal to move naturally but does not have to be so large that it makes it difficult to mange the animal and the space it is in.  Too many regulations that are too specific for any species can be harmful to the individuals within that species or prohibit the reasonable care of that species.

Please do not base regulations on advise from organizations that have no real interest in the responsible keeping, breeding and use of animals in captivity. Allow science based organizations with intimate experience with the species being regulated to advise on what minimal care should be set as to maintain a healthy, safe individual.', 'I am a retired animal health regulator.

I believe that the ongoing review that APHIS is conducting, regarding its regulations, is a great idea, and I am glad that APHIS acknowledges that marine mammal parks and facilities in the United States are dedicated to making sure that they provide outstanding care and treatment of their animals. Oceans of Fun is one of those facilities that goes above and beyond to care for their animals and educate the public as well. Facilities such as Oceans of Fun are imperative for the education of the public on marine mammals and for the conservation of these species out in the wild. Oceans of Fun has held a large influence as to why I have pursued a career in animal care. When I was a child I remember going to educational shows and interactive programs that educated me about why it is crucial that we help protect these animals and our planet, while doing so with animals that are healthy and living in outstanding conditions and habitats. I participated in a program called Sea Lion Splash, which educates children about the importance of marine mammals, such as California Sea Lions and Harbor Seals, and allows the children to learn what a marine mammal trainer does in a day on the job. I made a connection with a male, California sea lion named Slick, and I still have a picture with him, from the program, to this day. When I started as an intern at Oceans of Fun, almost 14 years later, Slick, now nearing 30 years old, is still thriving and educating today's children, due to the outstanding care and environment that the trainers at Oceans of Fun have dedicated their lives to providing to animals such as Slick. Oceans of Fun has helped educated me further on why marine mammal facilities are necessary to help educate others, conserve these animals, and provide an education on the proper way to care for these animals.  Their incredible passion for these animals' well-being and conservation has inspired me to continue to educate others about marine mammals, in hopes that future generations will be able to experience and fall in love with these magnificent creatures, as I did 14 years ago.

I am strongly against any animal being held in captivity unless it is for rehabilitation or other health reasons. I do not believe that animals should be held in captivity so individuals and corporations can make money off of them. However, this is a separate issue that will be hard to change. If animals must be held in captivity, then I believe it is only fair to give them proper living conditions. This rule will allow animals to have more space to roam, better quality water, better ventilation, shaded areas of shelter, and minimum qualifications for individuals working with these animals. These are all basic necessities that these animals should already have. These animals should be entitled to have the happiest and healthiest lives possible while in captivity. Also, many of these changes will require little to no costs to implement. It is our duty to protect these animals who cannot speak up for themselves. These are just a few of the many reasons of why I strongly support this proposed rule change.', 'I\'m not a member of the International Marine Animal Trainers\' Association (IMATA), but I know some members of IMATA who have dedicated their professional lives to actually providing daily care to marine animals in zoological settings, I can assure you that the  first priority of these people is to act as the guarantors of the welfare of those in their charge.     IMATA members and colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species  to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.   After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.

I was there in February and participated in the Trainer Experience which was truly amazing. I then returned 2 more times within a week to enjoy other presentations. So, I got to see the facility at various times and in different kinds of weather.  As the trainer is working with the dolphins, the trainer is fully engaged and always looking out for the dolphins\' best interests. I saw many interactions with trainers and dolphins and the trainers are immensely capable of overseeing more than one dolphin as a time. It was obvious to me they truly care about them.  In regards to water clarity and that APHIS wants the trainer to be able to see the dolphins at all times during interactive sessions, that seems unrealistic with the dolphins in ocean water and the wind, churning of the water by the dolphins, etc. The dolphins are in a natural environment which is so important. Obviously, that could be achieved if they were in a pool in a zoo, which we wouldn\'t want for them. It\'s much better to be in a natural environment.  When I spent one-on-one time with the dolphin Talon, the overwhelming emotion I felt from Talon was ""pure joy"". Talon showed so much happiness, clicking and affection toward me that I in turn felt immense joy.  It was truly a spiritual experience.   Thank you APHIS for your commitment to animal welfare.

In appreciation,  Janice Huss', 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  The murder of animals in their native habitat due to man made reasoning (which is flawed) has to stop.  Stop playing God!  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'Sea world has been a long time rescuer an educator on behalf of our wildlife!!!

As others have stated, I recommend that any modifications to the APHIS regulations be based on the most current science and information from the marine mammal specialists who have the most experience with these animals and would like to share my perspective on why I believe this to be true.  I believe it's essential that we have marine parks and aquariums to educate the public and increase our collective knowledge of these animals to better protect them in the wild. Many people might never have the opportunity to see these amazing animals if it weren't for these facilities.  As a supporter of marine parks and aquariums, and as a person who is passionate about the welfare of animals and preservation of species, I have learned so much from these facilities and believe they are beneficial to understanding and inspiring crucial conservation efforts.   I have worked at Dolphin Quest, alongside animal specialists and professionals, for the past eight years.  We are committed to animal wellness, inspiring conservation through guest interactions and providing a setting conducive to research support where scientists learn from our animals and how they can be better served in the wild.    Dolphin Quest meets and exceeds Animal Welfare Act (AWA) standards regarding dolphins under human care.  The animals under our care live lives filled with enrichment, social, mental and physical stimulation.  Our specialists are dedicated to providing a nurturing environment, strong bonds and trusted relationships.  It is my belief that the animals under our care have more than just their needs met, this is their sanctuary, this is where they thrive.    For almost thirty years, Dolphin Quest has successfully and safely conducted interactive programming.  To introduce additional unnecessary regulatory standards would be both burdensome to the regulatory body and unreasonable given the effective AWA standards that currently exist."", 'I am an active volunteer at Oceans of Fun in Milwaukee, WI and participated in a 5 month long internship with this facility. Through my internship I learned so much about the animals, our environment, and conservation. I also witnessed the dedication the trainers put into building a solid relationship with our animals in order to give the best care they can by training. The amount of passion they have for the work they do never goes unnoticed and the work they do is always to their fullest potential. They not only have the dedication to give the best care to our animals, but they are also dedicated to teaching their interns and volunteers to provide the best quality care for our animals by working to maintain the environment that our animals live in. Everything I have learned and witnessed at Oceans of Fun has inspired me to improve my daily actions to help with the conservation of our environment.    Oceans of Fun provides many interactive programs along with shows that educate the public on our animals, the environment, and conservation. Through my time assisting some of these programs I have seen the amazing effect it has on the public. I see people leave our facility everyday inspired to improve their actions in their daily life to support our environment, and that to me is what facilities like this are all about.

After watching the documentary ""Blackfish"", I have had a growing concern for animals in captivity.  I feel that the treatment of this animals being forced to live in a place that is not their natural environment, so be treated a lot better.  I believe animals who are being removed from their natural environment should at least be in an environment that accommodates to their welfare.  Living in a confined living space can not be easy for them.  They don\'t need added stress of not having the appropriate temperature water or space to be active and live.  I support the need for revisions in a regulation that has not been changed in well over 10+ years.  Times have changed since the last revision and the animals\' welfare should reflect that.', 'I work with the sea otters at the Georgia Aquarium and we currently have a geriatric female that is 19 years old.  As her mobility has become a challenge and her ability to get out of the pool has become more difficult, we have explored various ways in which to assist her.  In her case, we did install a ramp, but she does not utilize it. Our team found that raising the water level of her habitat was a more successful way of assisting her in and out of the water. I feel the mandate from APHIS to make ramps a permanent fixture in all sea otter and pinniped enclosures is unnecessary - as this would not have supported the goal in this case. As animal care professionals, we are charged with making whatever accommodations are necessary to help address any issue that arises in the care of these animals.

Please do not allow a few outspoken professional protesters ruin what is an organization that truly cares for the animals.', 'My name is Nicole Enright, and I am a professional Dolphin Care Specialist currently working at The Mirage Dolphin Habitat. I have been a professional marine mammal trainer for over 5 years, however I have been a professional animal trainer for over 10 years all together. I am currently a member of the International Marine Animal Trainers Association, and as such, I am proud to be among the top professionals in the animal care, husbandry and training field. I have had the opportunity to review some of the suggested changes to the current regulations regarding marine mammals in a managed care environment and I have a few comments I would like to submit for consideration. Interactive programs: In my experience, there is no evidence to support, peer reviewed or otherwise, that animal and guest interactions are inherently harmful to either the animal or the guest. There are a number of safety regulations already in place, and I believe, rather than implementing further blanket regulations, that safety inspections should be done on a case by case basis, taking into consideration a facilities safety record, and animal health and enrichment programs. Also, the definition of an interactive program should take into consideration the extreme differences between a program in which a guest is either on a dock or behind a barrier, or a situation where an animal is brought out from their enclosure under stimulus control, vs. a situation where a guest is completely free contact in an animals enclosure/ in the water with the animal. Both these scenarios offer significantly different degrees of guest and animal variables. Time limits for sessions: Again, there is no scientific evidence to support that guest interactions with the animals are inherently damaging, and while I am open to limiting the amount of time an individual animal is asked to spend in direct contact with the public (excluding viewing areas), I do not believe this should apply to the animal caretakers/ trainers. This decision should not be made with the idea that these guest interactions are in any way harmful to the animals, but rather as a means to support more time for other training(husbandry, research etc.) and to prevent over working of the animals. Our interactions with the animals are an essential part of their daily husbandry and enrichment. Limiting the time we can work with the animals will inherently limit the amount of world class care we can provide them, and thus possibly limit their quality of life. I do, however believe that the amount of time guests will be allowed in direct contact with the animals, should be an amount determined by unbiased scientific studies, not an arbitrary number decided upon by anybody. The guest interactions are simply a part of the animals training day, and enrichment, and by limiting this arbitrarily, we could hinder opportunities to further their quality of life. Trainer to animal ratios: In my experience, a facility that is adequately staffed is able to work more efficiently and care for the animals more thoroughly. With that being said, the animal to trainer ration should, however, not be applied to training or interactive sessions. The reason for this is that it would limit our ability to work very important social sessions with the animals, as well as providing variability to their day. Being able to work with animals together, in  ""teams"" can help support good social compatibility within the social structure, as well as provide enriching opportunities. IF an animal to trainer ratio should be implemented, it should refer to trainers on staff, not trainers per session. Undesirable behavior: As animal BEHAVIORISTS, it is our experience and expertise that should be referenced when determining the best way to manage undesirable behavior. The general public has a very limited understanding on operant conditioning and how it is used to manage undesirable behavior. Therefore, the best people to determine appropriate courses of action, based on an individual animals learning history, the specific scenario the target behavior was demonstrated, and the future learning goals of that animal, would be professionals who understand that animals behavior, and behavior as a whole, IE: members of IMATA. In conclusion, I would like to thank APHIS for their recognition of the outstanding care marine mammal facilities in the US have provided thus far, and for further diligence in ensuring that marine mammals in our care receive the best possible care. I ask that as always, you continue to consider animal welfare as a priority, and do not feel compelled to change regulations based on a vocal minority of the public who speaks not based on scientific knowledge, but on emotion. Thank you!!', ""Dear Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Over the past couple years I have done many programs at many marine parks like, Oceans Of Fun, Clearwater Marine Aquairum, Gulfarium, Gulf World, Discovery Cove, Seaworld, and etc... In each program I participate in I make a connection to the animals. Throughout each of these programs I have learned and noticed all the work trainers dedicate there time into caring for the animals. The staff provides a clean and safe environment for the animals, and use much enrichment and positive reinforcement to stimulate the animals. Another way the staff enriches the animals is by human interaction. It is very clear when you visit a facility that the animals enjoy their training sessions and interactions with humans. It is also clear to see the trainers never force there animals to do anything. I notice they have different ways to enrich an animal by toys, food, and more. These programs I have done have inspired me and taught me much about conservation. They have inspired me to improve my daily life actions and support the beautiful environment around me. I very much appreciate the work they do at Oceans of Fun and other marine mammal facilities, because they take great care of their animals and as I've seen provide daily entertainment for them. Thank you for your commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that the U.S. Marine mammal parks are providing top quality care for the animals and education to the public, and that you didn't feel compelled to unesseccarily change regulations.

Again science is proven and Sea World uses science and very caring staff that are very knowledgeable.', 'I am a supporter of accredited zoological facilities and aquariums and marine parks and have been personally inspired by my experiences at Georgia Aquarium.  I applaud APHIS for evaluating, and where necessary, updating the regulations by objectively assessing the latest peer reviewed science and input from industry experts on the best practices for care of these incredible marine mammals. I am concerned that groups opposed to marine mammals in zoological settings misuse the process of updating care regulations in their attempts to end the display of marine mammals.  They do so by encouraging APHIS to impose rules which are not necessary, counter to decades of successful care programs and processes, and impede the great education and conservation work done by the zoological community.  I encourage APHIS to evaluate the marine mammal care regulations based upon on the merits of applicable peer reviewed literature and current best practice standards; in cases where insufficient literature exists, input and observation of successful practices within the industry should be strongly considered.', ""This rulemaking would slightly amend Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the handling, care, treatment, and transportation of marine mammals in captivity, but would not change the space requirements, which were last updated in 1984. At that time the science on marine mammal range patterns and typical travel distances in the wild was not well established.  More recently, however, a variety of longitudinal field studies have documented the geographic outlines of normal movements of a wide range of marine mammal populations, especially dolphin species and in particular Orcinus orca. These photo-identification and genetic studies have documented vast ranges and long distance travels for many dolphin species, especially bottlenose dolphins and again, most especially, orcas. Demographic studies have shown that these cetacean species live as members of multi-generational extended families, which are in turn associated at the population level with complex social systems.  Much of these mammals' behavior patterns are now understood to take place within tradition-bound, cultural societies. Technology has also emerged that allows scientists access to not only the vast distances traveled, but also the descents to hundreds of meters below the waves. Yet, APHIS states in its proposed rule that it is unaware of any science supporting changes in the space requirements, straining credibility. APHIS must substantially increase space requirements before finalizing the rule. With the research now available describing what marine mammals do in the wild, to continue to support obsolete and constraining space requirements for those in captivity is unjustified scientifically and unacceptable morally and ethically. The below references are intended to provide a sense of the current consensus of the scientific community establishing the vast space needed by the dolphin species typically held captive, especially orcas, the extensive social and familial networks dolphin species have evolved within, and the cultural capabilities dolphins have amply demonstrated.

I implore you to please use the science and facts, not emotions, to make regulations that are beneficial to all the animals and allow our superb facilities to continue to care fore them.', 'Stop the Killing!!!!!', 'As a member of the International Marine Animal Trainers\' Association (IMATA), an organization representing the individuals who have dedicated their professional lives to actually providing daily care to marine animals in zoological settings, I can assure you that our members\' first priority is to act as the guarantors of the welfare of those in their charge.   IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of physical settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in an even wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations for schoolchildren, from peer-reviewed research designed to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.  After having the opportunity to review the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.   If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.  Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day. With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.  With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.   Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using broad examples followed by ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.   I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', 'Sea world does great work  I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

Thank you.', 'Dear Dr. Kohn,  First of all, I would like to say that I am in full support of the comments submitted by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA), as well as by the Georgia Aquarium and Marineland Dolphin Adventure.  This is my 30th year in the marine mammal care and training field. I suspect that I am part of a very small number of commenters who have extensive experience with marine mammals in human care in addition to marine mammal stranding responses, marine mammal field research and, perhaps even more uniquely, the rehabilitation of bottlenose dolphins from zoological settings either deliberately or inadvertently released to the wild. I have cared for marine mammals in tropical and temperate climates, in both sea pens and in concrete habitats.  I feel that my perspective is well-rounded from all angles. I also want to recognize that the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) is a well-established and valuable regulatory document that has been crafted with decades of scientifically-based information, and any commenters who detract from the value of this document are either unfamiliar with the realities of animal care, or have an agenda that runs contrary to the proper care of animals in human care settings.  As a long-time animal care specialist, I am quite familiar with the tactics and manufactured ""facts"" of many of our opponents, and I trust that you and the rest of your team are well-versed in science and in reality so as not to acquiesce to simple propaganda. As you well know, we have just come out of a bottlenose dolphin Unusual Mortality Event (UME) which killed at least 1,700 dolphins (that we know of; who knows how many were not found) in the past 2+ years along the eastern seaboard from the coasts of New York to central Florida. The threats facing our oceanic and riverine marine mammals deserve so much more attention and protection from various animal ""rights"" groups. The marine mammals in the care of accredited zoos and aquariums simply make convenient targets for keyboard warriors, who seem to refuse to acknowledge that they are already well- regulated by the USDA, and continue to thrive in their homes...many, if not most, surrounded by family members since they were born in human care and not collected from the wild. It is distressing to see how many people continue to believe that our cetaceans came from Japanese drive fisheries, or that stranded and rehabilitated animals that are deemed un-releasable by NOAA Fisheries are kept in our facilities out of greed. I realize that many of your commenters may be better educated on the intricacies and nuances of this topic than these examples, but a quick spin around social media shows that this is indeed part of the narrative to drive emotion-provoked activity. I have the utmost confidence in the knowledge and expertise of you and your team to rely upon the opinions of professional experts in the further development of these modifications, and to not be swayed by the emotional pleas of the well-intentioned but frequently misinformed masses who are assuredly filling your in-box with form letters.  Thank you for your time and for your commitment to leaning on performance-based standards for many of your proposed changes to the AWA, and again, I fully support the comments from the AMMPA, Georgia Aquarium and Marineland Dolphin Adventure!', 'Before finalizing the rule, APHIS should substantially revise its proposals to revise and update the standards governing the humane care and handling of captive marine mammals. The current proposal ignores a wealth of scientific evidence obtained over the past three decades and essentially maintains a long-outdated status quo for the captive marine mammal industry.  Why does our government claim to be so ignorant?  I wish we had better people to vote into office.  The people that are running our goverment now are just greedy, selfish, and could care less about the people.  How are they suppose to care about Orcas when they are so driven by money that they can\'t see past the green?  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters.

I look forward to have the opportunity to visit SeaWorld and other marine mammal parks for years to come.  Sea World and Zoos are all great places to visit and learn about our world in a very different way.  Although it is important for animals to be given quality care, most organizations exceed those requirements.  As, I'm sure you're aware, activists can be very vocal and try to do whatever it takes to gain attention.  Those who oppose zoological organizations are basing their findings on misinformation and beliefs.    It is important that we put our whole world first and science based research is very important for our world.  It's also important, in the United States, that we remain competitive with our fellow nations in such research.  It pushes us all forward, whereas animal rights activists want to push us backwards.  I admire their passion for animals, but what they want is not good for anyone, including the very animals they are fighting to protect, which in some cases, have never been in the wild.  Sea World and organizations like it care deeply about these amazing creatures and set the standards for what animal care really should be.  I am proud to support them and their mission to further study and care for these amazing creatures."", 'It is my opinion that Seaworld does an exceptional job of balancing the rescue and care of wild animals who are too injured or sick to survive in the wild with humanely interacting with the animals in their care and showcasing their unique gifts to the world through their educational and entertaining presentations. To steal the opportunity for children of the future to actually see the incredible beauty and power of these whales and other animals up close would be incredibly short-sighted. It is much easier to dismiss the plight of something seen only in a book or movie than to ignore a living creature whom you have personally seen interacting and communicating with others of its own species as well as its human caregivers.

If zoos and parks like Sea World are closed or limited in what they do where will we take our children to learn about animals and sea creatures. Most people would never see a lion or a whale in nature. Most people cannot afford safaris and boats large enough to come across orcas or dolphins. I have loved going to zoos and marine parks all over the world, it is often our first stop when we travel. As a young child my dad made huge efforts to take me and my brothers to the Bronx zoo when the zoo in Springfield Mass closed. We went to the circus to see elephants and zebras in the parades, we loved the tiger acts. We never thought those animals were being treated badly. I follow this tradition with our boys and their children. Now that we live in San Diego we love to visit Sea World and the SD zoo. There is nothing better than seeing a young child be amazed as the orca swims by the glass, a dolphin tosses a ball your way or laughing with glee at the seals antics.

Please help protect these places in the regulatory process you are doing. Please do not be influenced by the film Black Fish. I have seen the film, I understand what they were trying to convey. I have a marine scientist son and another is in the environmental protection regulation field. I see both sides of the issues, but I do not agree that closing and limiting the scope of work at places such as Sea World is the solution, especially ignited by inflammatory  films and organizations that seek to close everything in the name of humane treatment, letting animals back into the wild etc.  Our zoos and marine parks in the US are wonderful places to learn, to relax, to bring families together over a picnic lunch. I understand and have seen some places that are not up to Sea World's standards. But this has not been in the US. I think it belittles the good works of Sea World to put them in this category.

Since other animals do not belong to humans at all, the least we ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.

It is truly a unique combination to be both an aquatic animal as well as a mammal!  I am a long time member of Dolphin Research Center and spent a summer there as a volunteer.  I was able to participate in many interactive programs including the dolphin swim programs, as well as leading groups of visitors around the lagoon at Dolphin Research Center.  The dolphins greet their visitors as all stroll around the walkways and it is absolutely clear that the dolphins enjoy the interactions and sessions with the visiting groups of people.  The dolphins have been so cared for and loved by the staff and trainers here, that if Dolphins could grow legs and get out of the water to be with us, there would be the compassion and loving relationship that exists between pets and owners.  The staff at Dolphin Research Center are so dedicated, that all take turns in the care of these marine mammals here.  Tasks are rotated and all spend a day, on a rotating basis, in the fish house for cleaning, sterilizing and loading coolers, as well as being available early mornings for any animal husbandry that may need to be performed before the Center opens.  The trainers  do an excellent job at working with the dolphins on training and initiating behaviors and fun interactions with the dolphins and the visitors and it is always the Dolphin's 'choice' to participate in the encounter.  At no time do I feel that safety was an issue when one trainer worked with more than one person at a time or that the natural lagoon environment posed a safety risk to myself during the short times the trainer or myself could not see the dolphins.

Thank you  While the agency has proposed several improvements to the standards, such as requiring shade for all outdoor marine mammal enclosures and ramps for older or injured seals, sea lions, polar bears, and sea otters to exit pools more easily, these are minor compared to the significant failures in the proposed rule.  The agency proposes no changes to the space requirements, claiming it is unaware of any science on which to base such changes. In fact, there is a tremendous body of recent research using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to monitor fine-scale movement patterns of individual marine mammals, especially cetaceans and polar bears. These species travel tremendous distances and dive very deep, making the current minimum space requirements totally inhumane. The best available science for seals, sea lions, and sea otters--even for the slow, plant-eating manatee--also supports major space increases.  The current space standards were set over 30 years ago and have no basis in science or even best practices within the captive display industry. As an example, for up to two orcas, a facility need only provide a circular tank with a diameter twice as wide and a depth half as deep as an average adult orca is long. This standard does not even allow the animal to position itself fully in the vertical plane (its tail would touch and drag on the bottom before the animal reaches full upright orientation). This cannot be considered adequate!  While the rule refers to peer-reviewed papers for proposed changes to some standards (e.g., lighting requirements), it claims the agency is unaware of such papers for other standards (e.g., temperature requirements) and therefore proposes no major changes. Yet a considerable amount of research has been conducted within the past 15 years related to most if not all of the affected standards.   The proposed rule would still allow pinnipeds to be housed in enclosures with tanks filled with fresh water. Allowing the maintenance of a marine mammal in fresh water is clearly an inappropriate welfare standard.  Several standards have been weakened, particularly regarding interactive programs such as swim-with-dolphin encounters. For example, the standard for the interaction time for each cetacean per day has been increased from two hours to three hours, not based on science or even industry best practices, but simply ""on information provided by licensees ... which suggested that the marine mammals would not be harmed by a modest increase in interactive time per day."" Facility ""suggestions"" represent a clear conflict of interest and should never be the sole basis for changes to standards.  The agency asked in previous notices if noise standards should be established. In several instances, noise levels, particularly in air, are extremely high (in theme parks, virtually every night there is a fireworks display directly over the marine mammal enclosures). Noise standards must be established for marine mammal facilities.  In sum, the proposed rule is grossly inadequate and fails to take into account current scientific understanding of the needs of marine mammals. APHIS must substantially strengthen the requirements for keeping cetaceans in captivity before the rule is finalized.', 'I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect that top quality animal care and important education is provided daily at their parks, and accredited facilities around the country.

I look forward to have the opportunity to visit SeaWorld and other marine mammal parks for years to come.  As marine parks (in general) are at the forefront of marine animal rescue, if such facilities are forced to downgrade or even close, it appears evident that far fewer such rescues could be facilitated...', ""Wow!  You guys really missed the point - many of your changes are for the WORSE!  Your committee needs to talk to members of IMATA and look at ALL the CURRENT research and get up to date on what is humane and what isn't.  Sticking a marine mammal in a tank with fresh water and nothing to interest it is merciless and completely inhumane.  Many of the marine mammals need deep water and much more space.  And they ALL need SALT water.  Also, forcing them to work another hour can shorten the life of a marine mammal.  They work enough as it is!    Plus many marine mammals need to be in family units not by themselves in a concrete and glass tank.  Also, being able to see the bottom of a habitat is absurd and wrong.  When they are housed in actual waters of the Gulf or Atlantic, and in the deep waters as they are SUPPOSED to live in, it is impossible to see the bottom and the tides change the waters all the time.  A better solution would be to test the water for contamination on a regular basis so that an inspector doesn't confuse particulate matter in the water as something unhealthy or toxic.    I live in the Florida Keys and the Dolphin Research Center, a non-profit group that protects and does extensive research with marine mammals, can be of great assistance to your committee because it seems that you have made grievous errors in this proposed rule to animal welfare for marine mammals.  This rule will cause HARM to marine mammals.

I have seen firsthand the care the veterinary and training staff put into their animals, and don't believe that anyone without their expertise is capable of making better decisions for the animals in their care. The parks work to maintain their accreditation with IMATA, AZA, and AMMPA, and no one outside of that field knows their work better than the people in the field. I'm completely in favor of parks being open with their practices, with letting the public know what they do, as well as why, and how, but I'm opposed to what seem like fairly random regulations which don't take into consideration the aptitudes and personalities of the individual animals."", 'I have personally been educated and inspired at SeaWorld and am writing to respectfully ask that your new regulations for U.S. marine parks continue to reflect the important animal care and education that is provided at SeaWorld.

Our cHildreth needs close up chances to see live animals and fish.', 'I have been in the marine mammal field for 18 years and have worked in many capacities with a variety of marine mammals. As a professional member of IMATA, an organization representing the individuals who have dedicated their professional lives to actually providing daily care to marine animals in zoological settings, I can assure you that our members\' first priority is to act as the guarantors of the welfare of those in their charge.    IMATA members and our colleagues care for and train marine mammals in a wide variety of settings, from inland habitats to ocean enclosures, and engage with the animals in a wider variety of contexts: everything from dynamic stadium performances to intimate interpretive chats, from in-water guest interactions to educational presentations, from peer-reviewed research to enhance understanding of ecosystems and species to veterinary care focused on the welfare of an individual patient. No matter the context, the one constant we believe is essential to ensure the health and welfare of marine mammals in any managed setting is providing them the opportunity for robust, diverse, and positive interaction with a qualified, professional staff with knowledge in best-practices and expertise in state-of-the-art animal training and care.  After reviewing the proposed changes to the APHIS regulations related to marine mammals, the additional components specific to marine mammal interactive programs seem unjustified based on the strong safety record of these types of encounters. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed scientific data that demonstrates a need for additional regulation or how further regulation would be a benefit to marine mammals.     If interactive programs are defined as ""any human-marine mammal interactive program where a member of the public enters a primary enclosure for a marine mammal with the intent of interacting with the marine mammal(s)"" - I believe that the definition should explicitly exclude guest contact programs in which the participants may sit/stand on a floating platform or shallow ledge, or remain poolside, as well as programs in which trainers bring marine mammals into a public area under stimulus control.   Additionally, I cannot support the proposed rule which stipulates that interactive sessions must not exceed 3 hours per day per animal. Based on my professional experience, I believe that the amount of daily interactive time should be based around the best interests and capabilities of the animals as determined by the caregivers that know them best. In general, training sessions have proven to be a very enriching part of an animal\'s day - providing physical/mental stimulation. The notion that somehow limiting or reducing this interaction would provide some benefit to marine mammals is not data-driven and has no scientific basis. Any changes to the management of the marine animals in our care should build on the high quality of our existing animal care and training programs, and provide additional opportunities for the animals to engage and interact with the professionals to whom their care has been entrusted. At its core, an interactive program session is simply a training session - which is a highly beneficial and important component of an animal\'s day.  With that said, in my experience, there is no indication that any restriction in time for interactive sessions is needed, and, is likely not in the best interest of the individual animal.   With respect to the proposed changes in attendant/animal ratios, creating a requirement that there must be at least one attendant per marine mammal in each session and at least one attendant positioned to monitor the session is not necessary. Since the inception of interactive programs in the late 1980s, trainers have safely conducted interaction programs with various ratios of animals to attendants based on the situational circumstances. As such, trainers have learned that having the flexibility to interact with animals in ""teams"" can be an enriching part of the animals\' training.     Finally, I have some concerns with the language used to describe ""unsatisfactory"" or ""undesirable"" behaviors. Using ""not limited to"" could create confusion for trainers leading these programs. A performance-based approach focusing on unsafe behaviors specific to an individual, the circumstances at hand and the location in which they reside is a preferable way to ensure safety-based decision making. Trainers are in the best position to best determine if an animal exhibits unsafe behavior and facilitate behavioral redirection or the termination of its participation in a session due to such behavior.    I would like to thank the agency for its diligent commitment to animal welfare. I appreciate that you recognize that U.S. marine mammal parks are dedicated to providing top quality care and public education and trust you will not feel compelled to change regulations that limit our ability to care for the animals.', ""To Whom it my concern we need SeaWorld to continue there work and care for and with our beloved sea animals.

I have seen dolphin interactions change peoples lives and educate them about things they didn't know before. I believe that some of the proposed rules will encumber people from gaining insightful and life changing opportunities.   I do not think each dolphin needs its own trainer during public in water or from shore interactions. I have seen dolphins thrive on a variable environment, rather than a boring structured, military like existence. Requiring the dolphin to stay with one trainer at a time and only having one dolphin per trainer, will severely limit dolphins ability to have a variable interaction on a day to day basis. Variety is the spice of life.   I also believe that the water clarity question is unnecessary. I agree that bacteria and other contaminants should be monitored, but water clarity, especially in a place that has ocean water enclosures, is not a realistic barometer of health or cleanliness. Through my job observing dolphins and humans interacting, the humans rarely leave eyesight. They are always safe even though you can't always see the dolphins. If the water levels are contaminant free or within levels, I do not believe that water clarity will enhance safety.  Finally, more record keeping is only going to create needless work and material that will rarely if ever be utilized. The current recording scheme is more than adequate, and provides detailed descriptions of every trainers dolphin interactions throughout their day already. There is no need for more records. They stink.  Overall, I see dolphins interacting with guests daily, in a happy for dolphins, happy for humans setting. It takes mutual respect and an ability to be flexible to meet everyones needs, human and dolphin. Please don't add rules that will make it harder to provide life changing opportunities to people while still achieving a happy, variable, and socially stimulating environment for the dolphins.
